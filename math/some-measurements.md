Misc Comparisons
================

- Framerates
    - Movies : 24 FPS
    - Video Games : 60 FPS (Hz)
    - Why the difference?
        - The separation of camera and subject in film
            - In video, there's no synchronization between the thing being filmed and the shutter speed of the camera, so this leads to a certain amount of inherent blur in each captured image
            - There's no such natural blur in a video game, so it has to run at a much higher rate
        - In video/film there's an upper limit to how quickly you pan (to keep the motion from being choppy) - not so with video games
        - We scrutinize motion much more in an interactive context 
            
- Perception
    - Vision
        - Visual processing speed:
            - Humans: 60Hz
            - Cats: 60Hz
            - Dogs: 80Hz
                - this is why dogs don't care what's on the TV as much as cats 

- Atoms, at a max, are 3x10-10 meters long.
- Proton's mass: 1.6726 x 10-27 kg vs Electron's mass: 0.00091 x 10-27 kg vs Neutron's mass: 1.6749 x 10-27 kg
