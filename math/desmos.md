Desmos
======================

* Good interactive tutorials [here](http://learn.desmos.com/)

* Graphing points
	* Just enter something like (0,3)
	* Or a group of points (0,3),(2,1),(5,4)
		* Alternately, you might convert a list of points to a table to conserve space
* Adjusting window Settings (zoom)
	* Use the zoom buttons
	* Or for more control, you can click the graph settings (wrench) icon and then set the axes' ranges along with step size.
	* You can also click and drag around the graph or double click to zoom in a spot
* Sliders:
	* You should be able to add sliders for each variable that is not in the x,y plane displayed
* Restrictions:
	* Domain and Range restrictions can be added to function entries:
		* \\( y = x^2 - 1 \{ y \lt 3 \}  \{ x \lt 0 \} \\)
		* \\( y = sin(x)  \{ 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi \} \\)
		* Note- restrictions are not zooms!
* Tables add points
* Enter a formula like: y = sin(x) and it will graph immediately.
	* If you click the Gear icon and then 'Convert to Table', you can add points.
	* But 'Convert to Table' makes it hard to edit your function, so you might want to duplicate it first.
* If you define your functions with function notation:
	* So $$ y = x^2 / 2 \rightarrow f(x) = x^2 / 2 $$  
	* Now you can call $ f(x) $ throughout the graph.
		* You can graph individual lines
		* You can convert to table
		* ...
