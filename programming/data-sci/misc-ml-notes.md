  - thousands of dumb cores on GPU's enabling Deep Learning Evolution
    - FPGA's will improve
  - Comparisons of current ML to biology
    - Connections per Neuron in ML: about level of a cat
    - Number of Neurons (ie complexity of models) in ML:  about the level of a frog
    - Estimate when we get the same number of neurons as the human brain: 2050
  - Problems
    - Approximating human brain
      - Human brain has 100 billion neurons
      - 1,000 trillion synaptic Connections
      - The message complexity of neurons is way more complex than what flows through ann's
      - presenter thinks we'll need quantum computing to address the computational complexity of the human brain
    - Neural Nets are black box
