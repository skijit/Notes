The 'Dynamic' Type
===============

- An object of type `dynamic` bypasses static type checking
- Usually, it behaves like an `Object`
- You can call anything against it, but you may get runtime errors
- The result of most dynamic operatiosn is also dynamic
- Any object can be converted **to** a dynamic
- Implicit conversion is ok to: you can assign a dynamic to a typed variable
