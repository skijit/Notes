- **Basis Function**
    - Super short version: a function you can combine with others to describe a more complicated function.
    - Basis Function: A mathematical function which can be combined with other such functions to describe a signal.  
    - In a vector space, V,  a **basis** is the (sub)set of of vectors which can express all the other vectors in V as linear combinations.
    - So Basis Functions are like basis'es except they apply to signals/functions, rather than Vectors.
