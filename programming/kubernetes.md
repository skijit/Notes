## Running Kubernetes locally
  - There are two options:
    1. Docker for Desktop now includes Kubernetes bundled
      - Windows-only
    2. Minikube 
      - Cross-platform
  - [Comparison of both approaches](https://codefresh.io/kubernetes-tutorial/local-kubernetes-windows-minikube-vs-docker-desktop/)
    - TL/DR: for Windows dev and getting started, go with Docker-Desktop.  Otherwise Minikube.
  - Minikube
    - lightweight kubernetes implemention that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster with only 1 node.
    - available for windows, linux, macOS
    - `minikube version`
    - `minikube start`
    - kubernetes CLI: `kubectl`
      - `kubectl version` will show you the client and server versions
      - `kubectl cluster-info`
      - `kubectl get nodes`
- Deployments
  - Deployment Configurations tell kubernetes how to create and update instances
  - The kubernetes master then realizes this configuration

## Core Concepts

### Cluster Basics
- Kubernetes cluster includes 2 things:
  - Master: manages the cluster...
    - scaling
    - scheduling
    - allocating processes to nodes
    - updating
  - Nodes: workers
    - Runs containers (aka node processes)
    - Each has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating back to the cluster master.
- Cluster should have a minimum of 3 nodes
- Kubernetes API:
  - hosted on master
  - node - master communication
  - end user (kubectl) - cluster communication

### Kubernetes Control Plane
- Refers to all the kubernetes-related processes running in your cluster (i.e. hosting-oriented processes, not your application)
- Cluster Machines is divided into 2 types
  - Master
    - Only 1 per cluster
    - Runs 3 (+2) processes
      1. kube-apiserver
      2. kube-controller-manager
      3. kube-scheduler
      4. etcd: key / value store used as k8's internal cluster data
      5. cloud controller manager - runs controllers that interact with cloud providers
  - Nodes
    - Usually 2 or more in a cluster
    - Runs 2 (+1) processes
      1. kubelet
        - communicates with the master
        - makes sure containers are running in a pod
      2. kube-proxy
        - cluster network services
      3. container runtime: usually docker, but also containerd, cri-o, etc.
- Admin interacts with the cluster via the CLI, `kubectl`, which communicates with the master, and lets them:
  1. Create kubernetes objects which describe the desired state of the cluster.      
  2. make modifications to the cluster
  - Cluster is responsible for realizing the specified configuration changes (aka 'desired state').
- Additional Cluster Services
  - Cluster DNS 
    - serves DNS records for Kubernetes services and containers started by Kubernetes
    - Runs in addition to the other DNS servers in the environment
  - Web UI Dashboard
    - manage and troubleshoot the cluster
  - Container Resource Monitoring
    - centralized store of time series metrics about containers running in the cluster 
    - a UI for browsing that data
  - Cluster-level logging
    - mechanism for capturing container logs and centralizing in a log store, with a search/browsing interface
  
### Configuration
- [useful page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
- K8s is controlled through a restful API
- That API is described through the swagger / Open API schema
- Two common clients for the API
  - `kubectl`: the user CLI
  - Client libraries called from within apps
- The Rest API payload is called the **Object Spec** and it's formatted as JSON
  - Object Spec describes the desired state
- But if you use kubectl, you'll typically specify the Object spec as a YAML configuration file, and kubectl will convert this to JSON and the corresponding API call.
- Example:
  - Config file

    ```(yaml)
    # application/deployment.yaml 
    apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.7.9
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```

  - Kubectl call
    - `kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml --record`
      - I think it's ok if the object spec is accessed via the local file system
- Required fields in an Object Spec  
  - apiVersion - Which version of the Kubernetes API youâ€™re using to create this object
  - kind - What kind of object you want to create
  - metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
  - spec
    - the format depends on the object type (e.g. it's one format for a Pod and another for a Deployment)

### Common Object Attributes
- **Names**
  - All K8s object types have a standard, unambiguous **Name** and **UID**
  - **Labels** and **Annotations** exist to add user-provided attributes to these objects
- **Namespaces**
  - This is a way to partition resources in a single cluster
  - The use-case is when you have multiple teams or projects sharing a cluster, but you want to have them maintained separately
  - Cluster DNS entries will expose cluster resources (e.g. services) with their associated namespace: `<service-name>.
<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local` 
  - When no namespace is supplied, the default namespace is... `default`
- **Labels**
  - Labels let you associate user-defined key value pairs with an object.
  - Within a particular object, a key is unique
  - Example labels:
    - "release" : "stable", "release" : "canary"
    - "environment" : "dev", "environment" : "qa", "environment" : "production"
    - "tier" : "frontend", "tier" : "backend", "tier" : "cache"
    - "partition" : "customerA", "partition" : "customerB"
    - "track" : "daily", "track" : "weekly"
  - [See these labelling best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/)
- **Selectors**
  - Label Selectors provide a query syntax for objects based on their assigned labels
  - There are a few different syntax variations
    1. [Equality-Based](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#equality-based-requirement)
    2. [Set-based](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement)
  - Usage scenarios
    - **From the CLI**
      - Ex: `kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=frontend`
      - the `-l` is a label selector
    - **In a Service Object Spec**
      - The set of pods that a service targets is defined with a label selector
      - The service object spec looks like this:

      ```(yaml)
      selector:
        component: redis
      ```

    - **In a Pod Object Spec**
      - Here the node which is selected when it has the label `accelerator=nvidia-tesla-p100`

      ```(yaml)
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Pod
      metadata:
        name: cuda-test
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: cuda-test
            image: "k8s.gcr.io/cuda-vector-add:v0.1"
            resources:
              limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: 1
        nodeSelector:
          accelerator: nvidia-tesla-p100
      ```

    - **Other Object Specs that might use a label selector**
      - Equality Based Syntax
        - Service (above)
        - Pod: (above)
      - Set-based syntax
        - Job
        - Deployment
        - Replica Set
        - Daemon Set
- **Annotations**
  - Like **Labels**
    - Associate k/v pairs with objects
    - Aribtrary, user-defined, metadata
  - Unlike **Labels**
    - Not the basis for querying (selecting).
  - So: the data can be retrieved (by tools and clients) but not formally searched
  - Common examples of metadata:
    - Build, release, or image information like timestamps, release IDs, git branch, PR numbers, image hashes, and registry address.
    - Directives from the end-user to the implementations to modify behavior or engage non-standard features.
- **Field Selectors**
  - Let you query k8s resources based on system-defined fields
  - The fields are specific to the object type, but all objects have:
    - `metadata.name`
    - `metadata.namespace`
  - Example of a chained field selector:
    - `kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase!=Running,spec.restartPolicy=Always`

### KubeCtl Approaches
- [ref](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/overview/)
- There are 3 different approaches to specifying objects / cluster using KubeCtl:
  1. [Imperative commands](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/imperative-command/): The CLI with all parameters explicit - no Object Specs
  2. [Imperative object configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/imperative-config/): The CLI with different Object spec yamls referenced
  3. [Declarative object configuration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/): Minimal CLI - almost everything is specified in the object spec files in a directory
- You want to choose one approach and stick with it
- Option 2 is the most mature and works well with CI/CD piplelines to production
  - This should be the starting point.

### Nodes
- node = worker machine
- node can be a vm or a physical machine
- each node is capable of running pods and is managed by the master
- Unlike other objects (e.g. pods, services), using the kubectl to create a node will not actually create the node...
  - it only creates the underlying representation
  - then it will report on the status of the node

### Containers
- Create your docker image and push to a registry before referring it to a K8s pod
- Kubernetes has native support for the Google Container Registry (GCR), when running on Google Compute Engine (GCE). If you are running your cluster on GCE or Google Kubernetes Engine, simply use the full image name (e.g. gcr.io/my_project/image:tag).
- Configuring access to a private registry may require a variety of setup steps
- K8s container environment provides:
  - Filesystem based on an image and one or more volumes
  - Info about the container
  - Info about other objects in cluster

### Pods
- Pod is the smallest deployable object in K8s
- Pod represents a running process on the cluster
- Pod encapsulates 1 or multiple application containers
  - Usually just 1
  - Sometimes > 1 when they're tightly coupled (e.g. need to access the same volume)
- Pods provide the following resources to their containers:
  - networking
    - each pod gets a unique IP address
    - Every container in a pod can communicate using localhost
    - cross-pod communication (within a cluster) has to be managed via ports
  - storage
    - shared volumes are available within a Pod
- Pods are created by...
  - You  <- rather rare
  - A controller <- much more common
    - examples of controllers include: Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet
    - create Pods using a Pod Template that you provide
- Pods are lightweight and ephemeral (rather than durable)
- They run on a node until (OR's):
  - process is terminated
  - pod is deleted
  - pod is evicted (for lack of resources)
  - node fails
- Pod Templates
  - These are specifications which are included in other objects like Replication Controllers, Jobs, and DaemonSets
  - Unlike other object specifications, these templates don't refer to the current desired state.  It only guides newer replicated instances.
- Containers on the same pod can communicate via IPC
- In terms of Docker constructs, a pod is modelled as a group of Docker containers with shared namespaces and shared volumes.
- Each pod has a unique id (UID)
- Use cases
  - local cache managers
  - compression, snapshotting, rotation
  - moditors
- Pods are generally not replicated
