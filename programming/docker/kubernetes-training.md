Kubernetes in 3 Weeks 
====================

- OS's manage these Core Resources
  - CPU
  - IO
  - Memory
- From a dev point of view, Kubernetes manages the same resources (analogous to OS)
- "high Cohesion and Low Coupling" in Containers
  - cohesion: only including components that are relevant to job at hand.  remove unnecessary things.
- 8 fallacies of distributed computing:
  - Nw is reliable
  - latency is zero
  - bandwidth is infinite
  - nw is secure
  - topology doesn't hcane
  - only one admin
  - transport cost is zero
  - nw is homogenous
- Moving to nw, you also lose your ACID transactions
  - move into a world of eventual consistency
- see spaced-based architecture (book: fundamentals of software architecture)
- kubernetes replaced swarm, accepted by docker
  - kubernetes has 10+ years of building orchestrators, so swarm couldn't compete
- nomad is a good simple container orchestrator from Hashicorp
- look into meshing, istio, k3s
- there are kubernetes app developer certs
- players
  - amazon, MS, Google, IBM
  - and so many more (digital ocean, alibaba, oracle)
- "day 1" vs "day 2"
  - day 2 is the emphasis on uptime, performance, security, etc.  (sometimes a harder problem)
- etcd: state
- 16 essentials
  - scalability and elasticity
  - security
    - how do you get secrets into your microservice: they have secrets support
    - role-based access is supported
  - volumes
  - load balancers
  - portability
  - resource management (spend/consume less)
  - scheduling: decides where on the cluster to run your services
  - Declarative: it figures out how to implement your instuctins (i.e. not imperative)
  - Distributed
  - Networking  (service to service)  
  - Extensibility: operator pattern, custom resource definitions ()
  - Abstraction
  - Self-healing
  - Observability
    - Logging
    - Tracing (hops across a distributed system)
    - Metrics (real-time dbs, dashboards, etc)
  - Namespaces: you can put applications in different namespaces
  - High Availability
- Good book: "Kubernetes up and running"
- Arch
  - node: a physical or vm in the cluster
    - master nodes run processes that manage cluster  (you want at least 2 for HA)
    - worker nodes run your processes
  - pods: grouping of one or more containers
    - typically ~30 pods per node
    - you want minimal number of containers inside your ppds
  - services load balance betwen load replicated pods and do service discovery
    - basically- you have a service that are interface to pods
  - kubelet is sintalled on each node and is responsible for lifecycle of pods
    - it doesn't inherently know about the containers
    - it uses Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to start the containers
    - the container just needs to follow the Open Cainter Initiative (OCI)
      - Docker
      - cri-o
      - cri-containerd
      - crun
  - network plane ties everything together
  - etcd: kubernetes state (real and desired)
    - you need at least 3 replicated versions of this
    - implements RAFT concensus algorithm
  - controller manager:
    - lives on master node
    - communicates w kubelets to (eg) start pods on nodes
    - scheduler will figure out the how to pack pods into the nodes
  - ingress/node port: this is where outside customers come in from
- CLI stuff
  - `kubctl create namespace ticketing`
  - `kubectl label namespace ticketing venue=operar watch=cpu`
- Yaml 
  - always start wtih `apiVersion` and `kind`
    - example kind: `namespace`, `pod`, etc.
    - would tie into the controller-manager (control-loop) for namespaces
    - apiVersion: also called Object controller version
    - kind: also called Object Classification
    - other root level properites: `spec` and `metadata`
- ReplicaSet (another `kind`)
  - tells you the number of instances of a pod you'd want
- Deployment (another `kind`)
  - very popular.  cover pods, their replicaset, and how to roll them back or update them
- Jobs (another `kind` - kind of like a cronjob)
- Daemon set (another `kind`)
- You connect different yaml files and resource types through the metadata kv pairs
- ConfigMap and SecretMap
  - Can get mapped into a container
  - Security questions is an example
  - Data can be linked by 
    - environment vars
    - command line parameters
    - read-only mount
- 3 types of probes
  - liveness:
    - you'll set up an endpoint on your ms to prove health
  - readiness:
  - startup:
- HELM is a package manager for kubernetes
  - group a set of yaml files and bundle them together
- katakoda
  - search for 'first app' for kubernetes
- subscribe to alex ellis
- helm packages are called 'charts'
  - there are tons for things like kafka, rabbitmq, etc
- 

- Container Architecture
  - [read this](https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504)

## Session 2
- kubelet on each node connects to the CRI (container runtime interface) and that interfaces with container runtime
  - The container type just needs to implement OCI (open container interface)
- check out katacoda to see what a container looks like search 'decomposing'
- see the tool 'Dive' for exploring layers in a container
  - you can use it to shrink your image size too
- CI/CD pipelines create issues for kubernetes and docker
  - creates a problem due to nested stuff
  - a lot of times creating the container image makes sense without using the CLI
  - there are better tools to build the docker image inside k8s
    - kaniko, podman/buildah, bazel, k3c,
  - you might run these types of things as k8s jobs
- init containers
  - when a pod starts, you can run a series of init containers in sequence
  - they're supplementary to do the extra work
    - e.g. seeding a database
- knative
- tekton
- check out cncf.io (cloud native computing foundation)
  - see tiles in landscape
- there's a helm chart which runs a local docker image repository on your cluster
- `jq` is a cool tool for parsing json files
- Distillation Pattern (8 factors)
  - "making containers as efficient and secure as possible on k8s"
  1. high cohesion 
  2.low coupling
  3. Immutable
  4. Idempotent
    - antipattern for idempotence: tagging with "latest"
  5. Attack Phobic
  6. Small Images
  7. Rapid Startup
  8. Resource Frugality (runtime)
- Metadata
  - Annotations and Labels
    - both are key-value pairs
  - Labels let you do filtering in the CLI
  - Annotaions are more required metadata, but you can't filter
- See ConfigMaps and Secrets Katacoda  <-- importante!
- Volumes
  - Pod-specific (althernative to IPC)
  - Node-Specific
  - Cluster-specific
- Stateful Services
- Quality of Service
  - BestEffort
  - Burstable
  - Guaranteed
- Horizontal Pod Autoscalar
  - thre's a katacoda for that (search hpa)
  - defines metrics and scaling rules
- Security: TBD
- Pod Disruption Budget
  - Never go below the minimum number of pods
  - applies to event types:
    - Node draining: taking pods off a particular node
    - Hardware Failures
    - Node Scaling Downward
    - Probe Failures
- Affinity
  - Pods are marked to tell scehdule what Nodes they prefer or not
    - e.g. if you're running .NET full frameowk, you want a wnidows server (host)
    - something with a GPU
