## Where Serverless Wins
- Fast Scaling (supposedly)
- Less Maintenance
- Much simpler
- Pay only for what you use (although at some scales, this can be more)
- Faster development
- When you're not seeing consistent, sustained traffic

## Where Containers Win
- Runs on-Prem and in-cloud
- Local Dev environment
- Multi-platform
- Less of a vendor lock-in
- Full control of dependencies
- No black-box
- More control over the stack and components, which may become extremely important as complexity grows
- Highly interoperable
- Great for migrating legacy applications



## Hybrid Approaches
### Mixed Container and Serverless

### Containers as a Service

### WASM as a Service
