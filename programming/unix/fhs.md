## Linux Folder Structures
- Single vs MultiUser Mode
  - Single gives you root (for system repairs, updgrade)- but nw is disabled for security reason
- FHS: Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
  - defines how/where stuff gets placed in a linux/unix system
- `bin`
  - binaries like `ls` and `cat`
  - available in single user mode
- `sbin`
  - system binaries that a standard user wouldn't use, but sysadmin would
  - available in single user mode 
- `boot`
  - bootloaders- everything your system needs to boot
- `dev`
  - devices: each piece of hardware is exposed as a file (per Unix) (really pseudofile)
- `etc`
  - all your configurations for system-wide stuff are stored here (e.g. apt)
- `home`
  - user home directories
  
- `lib`, `lib32`, and `lib64`
  - static libraries, required by (at least) bin and sbin
- `mnt`
  - where you mount stuff directly
- `media`
  - where the OS typically automounts to
- `opt`
  - where vendor software, which is manually installed gets stored
  - cross-platform and commerical software usually goes here
- `proc`
  - pseudofiles that contain info about processes
  - every process has a directory with various metadata
- `root`
  - root users home folder
- `run`
  - tmpfs filesystem: it runs in RAM
  - processes what start in the boot procedure
- `snap`
  - self-contained applications that run in ubuntu
- `srv`
  - this is where you store files that are served by processes such as a webserver
- `sys`
  - way to interact with the kernel
  - similar to `run`- it's created every time the system boots
- `tmp`
  - files are temporarily saved here by applications
- `usr`
  - non-essential applications are installed here (but which might be part of the OS distro, unlike `/opt`)
  - `usr/local` is for local copies of stuff which might be installed OS-wide (e.g. bash, something built with `make`, etc.)
- `var`
  - any files which are expected to grow in file (variable size)
  - `/var/crashes`- crash info
  - `/var/log` - log files


## Mounting
- `mount` command will make an already created filesystem (e.g. a hard-drive partition, dvd, etc.) and make it useable to the OS
- `mount -t <fstype> <fs_source> <fs_target>`  <- fs_target must already exist
  - `mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/shared`
- `mount -a ...` when you don't know what the filesystem type is
  - mount tries to figure it out
- `/mnt` is typically where you would mount a local filesystem to
- `/media` is typically where you would mount a filesystem on nw to
  - also removable media often is mounted here
- you can specify permissions (ie to make it readonly) when mounting
- viewing current mounted filesystems
  - `mount` called alone will print a table that shows how things are mounted
  - `/etc/mtab` <- whenever you mount or unmount, this text file gets updated
  - `/proc/mounts` <- similar to etc/mtab
- `umount` is for unmounting
  - cannot be unmounted if it is 'busy' (ie have active handles)
- `/etc/fstab`
  - add mounting info to run at bootup
  - there are a ton of mounting options you can specify here
