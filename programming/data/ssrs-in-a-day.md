SSRS Outline
=========================

- Enterprise Reporting
    - Departmental std report
- Operational Reporting
    - What's happening
- Ad-Hoc Reporting
    - Digging deeper, customization

- Microsoft Report Definition Types
    - Report Types
        - Paginated Reports: Use Reporting services
            - Need it to be static, pixel-perfect
        - Interactive Reports
            - Use Power BI Desktop and Service
        - Mobile Rporting
            - Use Reporting Services Mobile
        - Analytical report and charts
            - Excel
- For Paginated Reports
    - Use SSRS
    - It's the On-premises reporting platform
    - Supports static or dyanamic reports
        - Created automatically
        - or on request
- Web Portal for reporting services
    - There's a dashboard, customizable
- Report Dev Tools
    - SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT- previously named BIDS)
        - It's a reduced version of visual studio, with a limited set of projects
        - the 2016 version has full backwards compatibility!!
        - It may just be add-on to VS or separate project templates
        - Supports source control
    - Report Builder
        - Can't create a shared data source
        - This is what you would use if you don't have an MSDN subscription
    - Mobile Report Publisher
- Using SSDT
    - Create a new project
    - Panes    
        - Solution Explorer
        - Toolbox
        - Report Data
- Data Sources:
    - Specify the target, platform, query
    - Supports typical backends (rdms), xml, sp list, analysis services cube
    - Shared and Embedded
        - Always use a shared data source
    - Create the data source (shared) before you create the rport
- 'Add New Report' -> wizard
- Select the shared datasource in the Report Data pane
- Then you add a Shared DataSet
    - Typically, these are not shared
- Can you combine datasets?
    - Sorta: You can use one dataset as a kind of lookup 
- Dataset properties
    - Fields: what you're projecting
    - These will populate in the Report Data pane
- Tabular/Text Data Objects
    - Table
        - Can be grouped or aggregated
        - Has a static list of columns
        - Grows in the Y direction
    - Matrix
        - Variable amount of rows or columns
        - Can grow in the X direction    
    - List
        - One row, one column, repeats for each dataset row
- To build a Tablix:
- Drag it onto the design surface
- Then drag dataset fields onto the tablix
    - You need to define the groupings: that's not part of the query
- Clicking on the top left box of the table lets you go to *tablix properties*- very useful
    - Sorting
    - Paging
- Doesn't give you a count of all the rows
    - But you could create an expression
- Doesn't preload all of the pages (for large queries)
    - Notice the pagination control will say 'x of 3?' since it doesn't know
    - You can create an expression to calculate all of the pages, if you need that 
- Other Toolbox items
    - textbox: titles and escriptions
    - rectangle: good for grouping objects together
    - image: logos/pictures
        - can be embedded, external, or put in the ssrs database
        - sizing, scaling options
    - subreport:  parent child
    - line: separate sections
- Integration with other websites
    - Iframes
- Headers and footers
    - Right-click on the white background of the design surface
    - You can put these in your template (which we would do informally)
        - We have Afton/NM templates which we can use (ask Jessica)
- Visual Reports
    - Chart
    - Gauge
    - Map
        - Basic
        - Bubble overlays
        - Analytical
        - supports ESRI shape file
    - Databar
        - small bar chart that hosws a data boint in a limited amount of space
        - used to show ouliers or problem areas
    - sparkline
        - small visual chart to show a trend
        - good for totals
    - Indicator
        - tiny gagues, for each row         

- Grouping
    - Details row: every time rs sees a unique row, it creates a 'detail' group.
    - Sorting works from the inside out
        - if a grouping is not working, look at the other sort screens
    - Try using the report with no grouping/sorting to start with
    - Group Types
        - Parent Groups
        - Child Group
        - Adjacent Group
- Report level filters are possible
    - Lots of operators: equality, comparison, top n, like, etc.
- Parameters
    - Two types
        - Query Parameters
            - MOdify the query string sent to the data source
            - Specify this on the data sets properties
            - Just add a parameter to the SQL
                - `select top 100 * from table wehere OderDate=@OrderDate`
            
        - Report Parmeters
            - Allow a user to pass something into the report
            - Report data pane: go to parameters and add a parameter
            - Specify a data type (primitives)
            - You can specify a list or leave it open to the user
                - You would typically have this drvien from another query/dataset
            - You can create a Text Box and in the expression underlying it, you can reference a parameter
- Embedding content
    - You can use an image and specify the reference type as 'external', and use the expression builder to determine the URL
    - You can use a text field and interpret it as HTML (similar approach as above): but it only recognizes a limited number of HTML tags (see books online for the list)
- Expression
    - Use Visual Basic
    - Being with '=' signs
    - Can drive:
        - Txtboxes
        - Group and Sort definitions
        - Queries
        - Data Sources
    - Building blocks
        - Field
            - [Sales]
        - Function
            - [Sum(Sales)]
        - Global Variable
            -[&PageNumber]
        - Report Parameter
            -[@MyReportParam]
        - Complext Expression
            - <<Expr>>
        
    - =Sum(Fields!YearlyIncome.Value)
    - =IIF(Fields!Gender.Value <> "M" AND Fields!Gender.Value<> "F", "U", , Fields!Gender.Value)
     - ="Page " & Globals!PageNumber & " of " & Globals!TotalPages

- You can get the expression to execute custom code (from a DLL)
    - Tough to think of a use case though- maybe to consume a web service
- Formatting
    - You can use regular expressions!
- Adding Code
    - Report menu -> Report Properties
    - Basically you add it in the text box
    - You just write a VB function
    - Might be useful if you need to loop over the data (or anything you wouldn't do in a normal expression)
    - Expression will look like `Code.MyFunction()`
- Drill through reports
    - Passing through one report to view another
    - They are linked together by "Actions"
    - Actions are accessible through a text boxs propertties
        - Link to an RS report
        - A bookmark in the same report
        - An external URL
            - This is a good way to link back to an application
    - The other use case is using subreports
- Subreports
    - Can be in a table
    - You specify the parameters too
    - All of that is in the properties
- New features in SSRS 2016
    - Web Portal
    - Mobile Reports
    - Subscription
        - Reports are emailed out to you or put on a share
        - Can be scheduled to run on an automated basis through schedules
        - Specify emails to send to or the destination file share
        - There is a web service for creating / changing subscriptions
- Security
    - Server level
        - permissions for the management page
        - Site settings: Roles: System Admin and System User
    - Item level
        - who has permissions to see the actual reports and folders
        - Roles include Browser, Content Manager, My Reports, Publisher, Report Builder
- To deploy from SSDT
    - Check the solution/report properties
    - Right-click the solution and select 'deploy'
