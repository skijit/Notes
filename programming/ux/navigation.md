Navigation in Web Design
===========
Notes on a collection of articles on nav from [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-navigation-showcases/)

## The Elements Of Navigation
- The labels of menu items should be informative independently, but also clearly separate from one another
- Icons / Pictograms can be very useful, but be sure they're intuitive

## Planning And Implementing Website Navigation
- Dividing content into Primary and Secondary Navs
- Misc content can go in Footers, special submenus, sidebars, etc.
- Card Sorting is a technique where you give participants a chance to organize different words, and that drives your structuring of primary/secondary navs (among other things)
- There are lots of ways of grouping items into a primary nav node:
    - Order of the process
    - Recent to oldest
    - Alphabetical
    - Most popular
    - Geographical
- Organize Hide/Show the nav structure by user level / role
- Horizontal vs Vertical
    - Simpler navs should be horizontal
    - When you need more space, you should use vertical, because vertical scrolling is acceptable, whereas horizontal scrolling is NOT
    - If your content is already going to be challenged to fit horizontally, then vertical nav is going to eat up precious space.
- Secondary navs can be Drop downs or Mega DropDowns (i.e. where they take up more space than the primary, or have many different options)
    - Secondary navs in MegaDropdowns can themselves be grouped.
    - If Drop downs are used, you need to have some iconography to indicate it can be expanded
- Put "Actions" (login, search, etc.) links on the upper right

## [Best Practices for Tabbed Navigation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/showcase-of-well-designed-tabbed-navigation/)
- One nice thing about tabs is that you get navigation plus it's it's own breadcrumb
- Typically used as a secondary navigation tool
- Good to break up a content-heavy page, but make sure you don't have too many tabs
- The sidetray secondary navigation seems to be a more preferable option these days, but keep in mind this occupies more space

## Some interesting Web App Templates
- Material Dashboard Lite [info](http://materialdesignblog.com/material-dashboard-lite-a-free-admin-template/) / [demo](http://creativeit.github.io/material-dashboard-lite/index.html)
- Some bootstrap-based [templates](https://colorlib.com/wp/bootstrap-admin-templates/)
    - I like the vertical nav with dropdown options [here](http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB019K3P8)
- There are a variety of Bootstrap-editor applications that let you build bootstrap-based layouts [comparison here](https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/bootstrap-editors/)
