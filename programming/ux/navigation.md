Navigation in Web Design
===========
Notes on a collection of articles on nav from [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-navigation-showcases/)

## The Elements Of Navigation
- The labels of menu items should be informative independently, but also clearly separate from one another
- Icons / Pictograms can be very useful, but be sure they're intuitive

## Planning And Implementing Website Navigation
- Dividing content into Primary and Secondary Navs
- Misc content can go in Footers, special submenus, sidebars, etc.
- Card Sorting is a technique where you give participants a chance to organize different words, and that drives your structuring of primary/secondary navs (among other things)
- There are lots of ways of grouping items into a primary nav node:
    - Order of the process
    - Recent to oldest
    - Alphabetical
    - Most popular
    - Geographical
- Organize Hide/Show the nav structure by user level / role
- Horizontal vs Vertical
    - Simpler navs should be horizontal
