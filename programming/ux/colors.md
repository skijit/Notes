## Additive vs Subtractive

- Color is a blend of visible lights
- Like any other wave, it can be deconstructed into the combination of other waves
- Primary Colors are just references to the base waves that you use
    - But different people use different primary colors...        
- Computer graphics reflect light back directly, so you can mix those primary colors together directly
    - Referred to as 'Additive Synthesis'.  You're just adding light.
- It's different for printing and painting.  The primary colors you use are **absorbing** all the other light, and only reflecting one back.
    - So when you mix R, G, B paints- the Red will absorb the green & blue, the green will absorb the red & blue, etc. until you have everything being absorbed => black
    - Even though the final mix is a blend of lights, those primary colors are interfering with each other and what light actually gets reflected.
    - This is why it's called 'Subtractive Synthesis'
- "Printer's Colors" = C, Y, M (Cyan, Yellow, Magenta)
    - As opposed to paint which is mixed together, printers put down 4 layers (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
        - The black just darkens things up a bit
    - Each layer is basically the same thickness
    - The "intensity" is really just based on the density of dots of that color in a particulr region.
        - Your eye will naturally blend them with the underlying white paper
    - C, Y, M are used because they can isolate individual primary (R,G,B) colors to not be reflected back
        - Cyan absorbs Red
        - Magenta absorbs Green
        - Yellow absorbs Blue
- Primary colors for computer graphics are the additive primaries: R, G, B
    - So that's all that will be discussed going fwd

## Color Wheel
![color wheel](/resources/images/programming/Simple_RGB_color_wheel.png)
- note that many color wheels depict 'painter's colors'- colors which lead to a different set of hues than additive
- primary colors R, G, B at 0, 120, and 240 degrees
- secondary colors (e.g. C, Y, M) result from combining two primary colors in their full intensities
- **Shade**
    - Painters refer to as 'adding black'
    - Decreasing the intensity of the color
    - Fully shaded = Black
- **Tint** 
    - Painters refer to as 'adding white'
    - Increasing the intensity of the color
    - Fully tinted = White
- **Hue**
    - A color not modified by tinting or shading
    - Formed by combining 2 primary colors
    - In other words, the kind of color you find on a color wheel, since that is just the blending of two different adjacent color components      
- **Tone**
    - Painters refer to as 'Adding gray'
    - Can reduce the 'colorfulness' of a hue

## RGB Color Model
- Used by CSS2
- Reflects the hardware design of "True Color" displays
- 32 bits per pixel: 8-Red, 8-Green, 8-Blue, 8-Alpha
- **Creating a Hue**
    - One color component has to be full intensity (255)
    - One color component has to be variable intensity
    - One color component has to be 0
- **Shading**
    - Apply this formula to each color channel: 
        - new_intensity = current_intensity * (1 - shade_factor)
        - where shade_factor is between 0 (nothing) - 1 (black)
- **Tinting**
    - Apply this formula to each color channel:
        - new_intensity = current_intensity + ((255 â€“ current_intensity) * tint_factor)
        - where tint_factor is between (nothing) - 1 (white)
- **Tones**
    - Apply both Shade and Tint to a color
    - Order does not matter

## HSL Color Model
- [src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYJTfGsi_mA)
- Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (aka Luminance)
- Used by CSS3
- Popular because it gives you a more common-sense way to tweaking colors than with RGB
- Hue
    - Corresponds with presentation in color wheel
    - Angular relationship between tones in the color wheel is easily determined
    - In CSS3, it is a value between 0-360.
        - 0: red, 120: green, 240: blue
- Saturation: 
    - 0% - 100% in CSS3
    - controls purity of color
    - at 0% you have a level of grey that is dependent on the Lightness level
    - at 100% you have the hue at it's full intensity
- Lightness:
    - 0% - 100% in CSS3
    - typical value is 50%
    - at 0% you have black
    - at 100% you have white
- Microsoft Paint will show you both RGB and HSL values side by side, so it's a good way to get a feel for the mappings
