BootStrap-Related Utilities and Notes
===========

## Theming
- [BootPress](https://www.bootpress.org/themeroller/) is an interactive theme-roller for bootstrap
    - Alternately, you could do this locally by customizing / recompiling the less file directly... but it may take some more time.
- [BootSwatch](http://bootswatch.com/) has a bunch of pre-rolled themes
