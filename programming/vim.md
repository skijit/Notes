=================

- `i` : Insert Mode (writing mode)
- `ESC` : Normal Mode (navigate & manipulate mode)
- Cursor Control:
  - `h` : left
  - `j` : down
  - `k` : up
  - `l` : right
  - `w` : start next word
  - `e` : end of word
  - `b` : beginning of word
  - Variations:
    - `3w` : like pressing w 3 times
    - *sim*
    - `3` `i` `go` `ESC` : Inserts 'go' 3 times
- Finding (character level)
  - `f` `o` : finds the next o character
  - `3` `f` `o` : finds the third o character
- `%` : Skip to matching bracket
- `0` : beginning of line
- `$` : end of line
- `*` : next occurence of the current word
- `#` : previous occurence of the current word
- `gg` : beginning of a file
- `G` : end of the file
- Goto a specific line:
  - `2` `G` : go to line 2
- Search
  - `/text` : searches for the next instance of 'text'
  - `n` : next instance of search
  - `N` : prev instance of search
  - You can also use regexps
- Insert a new line:
  - `o` : new line after current
  - `O` : new line before current
  - After which, you're in insert mode
- Delete character:
  - `x` : delete char to the left
  - `X` : delete char to the right
- Replace a character in place:
  - `r` then whatever character
- Delete
  - `dw` : delete first word to the right of the cursor
  - `d2e` : delete the next two words
- Repeat Last command:
  - `.`
