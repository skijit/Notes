## Inbound vs Outbound Marketing / Sales
- Outbound marketing is the traditional, "you go to them" approach
  - Email Campaigns
  - Trade shows
  - etc.
- Inbound marketing is where you set it up so that "they come to you"
  - Social media ads
  - Blogs, and they link to learn more information, etc.
- Sales = Same idea:
- Inbound Sales:
  - Customer/lead comes to you
- Outbound Sales:
  - You are going to the customer
  
## Long vs Short Funnels
- A longer funnel means more time/interaction/etc from the potential customer to make the sale
  - Although this can be more cumbersome for the customer, it can be used to get more valuable information from them throughout the process
