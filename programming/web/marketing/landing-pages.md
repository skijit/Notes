Landing Pages
===============

- Landing Pages can serve a variety of marketing purposes, but the most important is usually lead conversion
- Lead conversion means converting a random browser into a potential customer (possibly suggesting a follow-up action by sales team)
- Types of Landing Pages:
  - Lead Generation Landing Page: 
    - Most common
    - Linked to by homepage or elsewhere, but unlike the homepage, it is refined to a particular offering (the homepage is really a directory)
    - Request-Reward: Presents a form to collect information and will reward the user with an offer, ebook, etc.
  - Click Through Landing Page:
    - No form- just a clear call to action which the user can "click-through" to
    - Basically a middleman in the sales funnel
  - Squeeze Landing Page:
    - Just a form to add emails to a leads email list
    - They're short
    - Unlike a lead generation page- there is no reward
  - Sales Page
    - This is the bottom of the sales funnel: where you convince the user to buy
  - INformercial
    - Lengthy, story-based presentation of product
    - Goal is to get them to click through at the bottom of the page
  - Splash Page
    - Simple 'yes/no' call to action (e.g. language selection or whether an adult)
  -
