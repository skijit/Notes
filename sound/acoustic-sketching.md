Sound and Acoustic Sketching
========================

- notes from a Kadenze course

## Session 1 - Sound and Acoustics
- **Hearing**- Subconscious, passive
- **Listening**- Intentional, active
- **Sound**- The perception and cognitive representation of pressure waves
- **Audio**- Pressure waves captured in some media by a man-made device
- **Speech**
    - Listening Modes (per Shaeffer)
        1. Listening / Ecouter : Concrete / Objective
            - Active Listening
        2. Hearing / Ouir : Concrete / Subjective
            - Passive hearing
        3. Selective Listening / Entendre: Abstract / Subjective
            - Filtering out stuff from what we hear, to listen to something specific
        4. Understanding / Comprendre : Abstract / Objective
            - Grasping the meaning, treating the sound as having semantic content
    - Deep Listening (per Oliveros)
        - Philosophy of active listening, esp. for musical comprehension
        - Involves understanding the sonic, musical architectures
    - Listening Modes (per Chion)
        - only deals with listening, and not hearing
        1. Causal Listening: identification of source/origin
            - Superficial elements of the sound source
            - Includes inferences you can make without having a full comprehension of the content (e.g. if you don't understand a language)
        2. Semantic Listening: 
            - Understanding the full content and intention of the sound/speech
        3. Reduced Listening:
            - analytic and descriptive listening of sound
            - independent of meaning and context
            - basically, this is a critical listening to a sound
- **Music**
    - consider wind chimes as music
        - is there a distinction between creating music and musical sounds
- **Noise**
    - Noise is something which disrupts your ability to listen to something else
- **Acoustics** 
    - Characteristics of a space which affect the propagation of sound waves
    - Interaural Time Difference: The difference it takes a sound wave to reach one ear from the other
    - Difficult to locate sounds above us when they are aligned with the vertical axis (equidistant from our ears)

## Session 2 - Soundscape and Sound Walk
- **Soundscape**- environmental sounds within a space or landscape
    - Given a particular soundscape, could you infer what the landscape might look like?
        - You can probably pick out some basic characteristics (e.g. urban or natural, etc.)
    - Sound or combination of sounds that form or arises from an environment
    - How does a soundscape make you feel?
    - *Poetics* of soundscape
- Different elements of soundscapes
    - **Biophony**
        - All organisms
    - **Anthrophony**
        - Vehicles, man-made technology
    - **Geophony**
        - Wind, water, thunder
- Sonic Identity
    - Concept in Urban Planning
    - Involves the acoustic properties that help people relate to certain spaces
    - "The New Soundscape" (1969- Shaffer) - interesting book about soundscapes
- Sound Maps
    - Maps that represent soundscapes
    - Useful with *Noise Maps*, in cities
    - Freesound.org
        - Sounds are tagged by geographic location
