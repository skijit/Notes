## Lecture 1
- Sound represented as a signal is typically a single channel of information, whereas a sound field in air is like an infinitude of channels.
    - The sound is different at each location in space.
- Digital Audio Workflow:
    - Sound -> microphone -> ADC -> computer/memory -> DAC -> Loudspeaker -> ear
- When you make a recording, you...
    - Take out the infinitude of channels
    - Throw out the time domain (b/c things are arranged spatially e.g. on a wax cylinder or in memory)

## Book - Chapter 1
- Big stuff you need to learn in Acoustics:
    - How sounds behave in the physical world
    - How human hearing works
    - how to manipulate sound (using computers)
- A sound is time-varying motion of air (or some other medium) with an accompanying change in pressure. 
    - motion and the pressure depend on physical location.
    - motion can be periodic or not 
    - Knowing the pressure and motion at *one point* in the air does *not* inform you what the pressure and motion might be at any *other point*.
- Sound can be mediated as signals which can be mediated as recordings
- Analog signal is a voltage or current that goes up and down in time *analog*ous to the changing pressure at a fixed location.
- Usually the analog signal doesn't reflect absolute pressure, but its deviation from the avg atmospheric presure, and thus it can positive and negative values.
