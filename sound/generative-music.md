Generative Music / Algorithmic Composition Notes
==================

- Need a simple conceptual map to this approach

- Bottom Up Structures
    - Examples:
        - Serial Event { Sequence }
            - Length
            - Tonalites
            - Note can be { Note or Rest }
            - Range
        - Note Coincidence
            - Density      
    - Mappings to musical terms:
        - Rhythm
            - String of events
                - Notes and Rests
        - Melody:
            - Note Sequence + Rhytm
        - Harmony:
            - Note Coincidence ( + rhythm? )
        
- Top Down Structures
    - Phrase
    - Articulation
    - Variation

- Heuristics
    - Randomness
    - Subject to previous
    - Similarity??

- Apply heuristics at any level

- Modular approach to snap in new capabilities

- Why not make this into a midi generating website?
    - Perhaps some capabilities would be offloaded to the server side?
    
- **TODO** Merge in old notes from Sublime Text
