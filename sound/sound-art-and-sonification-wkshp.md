## Conceptual Background
    - **Sound Art**: Art that makes use of sound as a medium, but which is (maybe) distinct from music 
    - **Sonification**: Turning non-speech audio to convey information.  
        - Advantages: 
            - Temporal: we get a higher sample-rate than with Video... **todo**, compare to color), 
            - Spatial
            - Amplitude, 
            - Frequency resolution 
        - Example: Geiger Counter

## Audio / Visual Grain Machine
    - Max Patch
    - He controls Max via Mira on the iPad
    - You can see the video and audio granulated in sync

## Sonifying Visual Media
    - Various Tools
        - **Photosounder** (is what we'll use, medium price)
        - Audacity (free)
        - Metasynth (expensive)
    - His workflow:
        - Audio Recording -> Spectral Analysis -> Skribble on top -> Back into Audio with photosounder
