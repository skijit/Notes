- Considering timbre from 3 perspectives:
    - Perception
    - Analysis
    - Production
- Useful software:
    - [SPEAR](http://klingbeil.com/spear/)
        - Lets you analyze an input sound and it tries to recreate it as the sum of sinusoids.
        - You can tweak, export, analyze these sinusoids individually or en masse
    - Amadeus - Sound Editor
    - MEAPsoft - audio feature analysis
        - Lets you define, extract fragments of music which you can then recombine by any number of rules
        - The [examples page](http://www.meapsoft.org/showcase.php) has some fun/awful samples
    - Map/MSP
    - [RTcmix](http://rtcmix.org/) - a real-time software language for doing dsp. 
    - [rtcmix~](http://rtcmix.org/rtcmix~/) -a max/msp object for RTcmix
    - SuperCollider
    - sc3~ - a max/msp object for SuperCollider
    - pd
    - Chuck
    - chuck~ - a max/msp object for Chuck
    - maxlispj - commonlist max/msp object
    - [Sonic Visualizer](http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/)
        - Audio analysis software that you combind with [Vamp Audio analysis plugins](http://www.vamp-plugins.org/), which extract descriptors/feature extraction of various sorts
        - About Vamp:
            Just like an audio effects plugin (such as a VST), a Vamp plugin is a binary module that can be loaded up by a host application and fed audio data. However, unlike an effects plugin, a Vamp plugin generates not more audio, but some sort of symbolic information. Typical things that a Vamp plugin might calculate include the locations of moments such as note onset times, visualisable representations of the audio such as spectrograms, or curve data such as power or fundamental frequency
    - Faust
        - Faust is a high-level programming language for digital signal processing, with special support for real-time audio applications and plugins on various software platforms including Linux,Mac-OS-X, iOS, Android, Windows, and embedded computing environments. Audio plugin formats supported include VST, lv2, AU, Pd, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, and more

    - Stable Transient Separation m4L device
        - Implementation of Cort Lippe and Zack Settel's method of segregating spectral energy based the stability of the phase progression.[1] This method is well-known from Tom Erbe's Soundhack implementation.
        - This module attempts to separate the noisy and pitched aspects of a sound. The output can be set to one or the other. The technique isn't perfect, careful adjustment of the threshold parameter (usually near one end or the other) can produce satisfactory results. In order to have access to both the noisy and pitched parts of the sound at the same time, use two copies of the patch on different tracks.

- Important Books
    - [Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics -- Perry R. Cook](http://www.amazon.com/Music-Cognition-Computerized-Sound-Psychoacoustics/dp/0262531909/) 
        - good basic intro into psychacousticswork, plus a nice section on timbre. 
    - [The Psychology of Music, Second Edition -- Diana Deutsch](http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Second-Academic-Cognition-Perception/dp/0122135652/) 
        - a bit dated but still good psychoacoustics research. Deutsch is a pioneer in the field. Not so much about timbre; more focused on pitch/rhythm. 
    - [This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession -- Daniel J. Levitin](http://www.amazon.com/This-Your-Brain-Music-Obsession/dp/0452288525/) 
        read this for fun. Dan's an elegant writer, this even made the top 10 NYTimes bestseller nonfiction list. 
    - [Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound](https://www.amazon.com/Auditory-Scene-Analysis-Perceptual-Organization/dp/0262521954/)
- Other books:
    - [Calculus for Cats](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Cats-Kenn-Amdahl/dp/096278155X/)
        - Like 'who is fourier' for calculus
- Collection of Timbre Perception Theories
