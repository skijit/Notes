Misc Concepts in Video
=====================

- Interlacing: 
    - Scanning: how an image is displayed on a screen.     
    - 2 methods of scanning:
        - Interlaced: When you break the current image into (presumably horizontal) lines and display it over two frames:
            1. odd lines
            2. even lines
        - Progressive: Displays complete image (as opposed to interlaced)
            - Smoother than interlaced
            - Higher quality / resolution
    - Advantages of Interlaced Scanning:
        - Good for reduced bandwidth scenarios, such as broadcasting (esp analog tvs)
        - Cheaper hardware
    - Disadvantages of Interlaced scanning:
        - 'Image artifacts'- a discontinuity / jump in a fast-moving object between successive frames
        - More blurring
        - Moire patterns
