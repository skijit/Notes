Misc About Video Codecs
====================
- [Comparison of Video Codecs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_codecs)
- [Comparison of Containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_container_formats)

## Codecs
- Name is derived from *compression-decompression*
- Each codec has it's own set of tradeoffs involving size and playback characteristics
- The codec involves two things:
    - executable code (or just an algorithm) to manage the compression / decompression
    - the storage format for the compressed data
- Use spatial and/or temporal compression
    - spatial compression: simplify single frames (as with photos), looking for patterns, repetitions, etc.
    - temporal compression: creates a description of change between frames
        - keyframes: spatially compressed frames
        - regular frames: descibed only by their change from the previous keyframe
- Some codecs might by optimized for hardware support
- Each codec is likely to work with a variety of quality (e.g. bitrate, etc.) settings
- **H.264 / MPEG-4 AVC**
    - Most common codec used in camcorders
    - Typical *container* is AVCHD, but this is not necessary
    - Used in web video (e.g. YouTube, Flash, HTML5 Canvas), some BluRay
    - Offers high compression, good image quality, and scaleable
- **MJPEG (Motion JPEG)**
    - Used by older digital cameras/camcorders
- **DV and HDV**
    - Combination codec and container
    - Used by tape-based cameras
    - DV is standard definition
- **H.262 / MPEG-2**
    - Combination codec and container 
    - Used for DVD, early BluRay, and over-the-air HDTV
    

## Containers
- Can wrap a variety of compressed data together, perhaps from different codecs.
- Has additional metadata which is specific to the container format.
- **Advanced Systems Format (ASF)**
    - developed by microsoft
    - file extentions include .asf, .wma, .wmv
    - a wmv file is probably compressed with the wmv codec, but the container format is still asf
    - theoretically can playback files using any codec, but practically, it has problems with non-ms codecs
- **Audio Video Interleave (AVI)**
    - an older microsoft container format that nobody uses anymore
- **Quicktime**
    - Container format from Apple
    - Codec support is limited to whatever Apple supports
    - Also supports H.264
- MP4
    - Video codec is H.264
    - Audio codec can be AAC or other codecs
- AVCHD MTS
    - HD Camcorders
    - Video codec is H.264 AVC codec
    - Audio is encoded using Dolby Digital (AC3) or uncompressed
    - Has features like Menu Navigation, Slide Shows, and subtitles
- **AVCHD MTS**
    - aka MTS or TS
    - Originally designed for broadcast systems where signal degradation was likely. 
        
   
## Quicktime 
- [source](https://docs.cycling74.com/max5/tutorials/jit-tut/jitterappendixa.html)
- Quicktime movies are containers for tracks
    - Each track contains a particular type of media
    - Tracks types include:
        - video
        - audio
        - MIDI (called 'Music Tracks')
            - These will be routed to an internal QuickTime synth, but you can redirect them into Max if you want with IAC
        - VR Panorama 
    - Tracks define the spatial and temporal dimensions of that media
        â€” For instance, a QuickTime movie might be 320x240 in size, and 3 minutes in length, while one of its video tracks is 80x60 in size, and only 30 seconds long
    - Tracks might start at different points within the movie
    - Video tracks have visibility layers (values between -32768 and 32767): with the lower values being displayed on top
    - `jit.qt.movie` lets you interact with these types of tracks: query them, get data, figure out what codec they're using, etc.
- Frame-rate is based on a unique time system.
    - *Timescale* defines how many time values are available per second
    - *Interesting time* defines how many of these time values should elapse before emitting a new frame
- Different versions of QuickTime support different audio and video codecs

## ffmpeg
- Also can convert images and audio
- `ffmpeg -i my-input.avi sample.mp4`
    - with this extension, it knows the format to convert to (e.g. mp4)
- `ffmpeg -i quality_tester.mp4 -q 23 quality_23.avi`
    - *quality* (i.e. from -q) number between 23-30 is most common.  
    - Lower numbers mean higher quantities.
    - quality number only exists for avi, but mp4 has a similar parameter available from the -crf param.
- `ffmpeg -i inFile.mp3 -b:a 320k outFile.mp3`
    - bitrate applies to audio and/or video
    - `-b` = bitrate, `a` means the audio track, but you could also use `v`
    - common bitrates for audio:
    
    - common bitrates for video:
- `ffmpeg -i inFile -filter:v "crop=w=640:h=480:x=100:y=200" outFile
    - crops a video
    - last two parameters specify the upper left corner
- `ffmpeg -i inFile -filter:v "scale=w=640:h=480" outFile'
    - you can use arithmetic in this expression
    - you can also specify proportional scaling
- `ffmpeg -i inFile -filter:v "rotate=45*PI/180" outFile
    - this rotates it 45 degrees
- use ffprobe to get statistics on a video
