Hardware Stuff
=============
- [Good source](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/pcie-vs-sata-type-ssd-best/)
- [maybe better](https://sapphirenation.net/ssd-drives-part-connectors-interfaces-protocols/)

- Remember
  - Transfer rates use Bits (b)
  - Storage capacity use Bytes (B)

- Physical Connections
  - SATA
    - There are smaller and larger version
  - M.2 (NGFF)
    - Couple length versions of these as well
    - Also a form factor, like a 2.5"
  - PCIE



- PCIe vs Sata
  - SATA
    - Serial ATA Interface used by SSDs
    - it was developed in 2003
    - SATA 3.0 speed is 4.8 GB/s
    - Greater general compatibility than newer connection interfaces (e.g. PCIE's)
    - Much cheaper than PCIE's
  - PCIE
    - Peripheral Component Interconnect Express
    - Speed 985MB/s per lan with 1-16 lanes => 15.76 GB/s
      - Realistically, it's closer to 3.94 Gb/s
      - You'll see th biggest difference between SATA and PCIE when you transfer large files
    - Worse battery life
- NVMe vs AHCI
  - (Protocols)
  - AHCI is older and designed for HDD's and SATA
  - NVMe was designed for use with PCIe
