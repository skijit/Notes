These Truths
===============

## Chap 1: Nature of the Past
- Emergence of nation-states in Europe circa 1492
  - `Nation`: group of people of a common ancestry
  - `State`: political community governed by laws
  - Each nation state has a narrative (partially or wholly myth) explaining its origins
    - Most likely creates an "Us vs Them"
    - Creates a Truth which they may defend
- The origin story of the US is different
  - There is no common ancestry
  - To the degree that is English, we would have distanced ourselves from it
  - There are certain "Founding Truths" that emerge (actually, I think that's the point of the book)

### Other Interesting Facts
- It was rather unlikely that it was Western Europeans discovering the Americas (pg 11)
- The rise of wealth and capitalism in Europe was based on colonization, slavery
- Colombus' expedition was ostensibly for trade, but he claimed Hispanola for Spain (unlike comparable expeditions such as Marco Polo)
  - Probably sensed the capitalistic opportunity given the trends in Europe
- The power of the written word
  - Coining of the name "America"
  - The power to create a counter-narrative on colonism/empire
- The self-conception of the English - their Truth in opposition to Spain
  - Their reluctance to colonize the Americas
