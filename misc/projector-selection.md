Picking a Projector
=============
- Notes on Picking a Projector

## Video Projectors vs Data Projectors
- Video
    - Not as bright - assume you'll be in a dark room
    - Higher contrast / realistic color - looks better in movies
    - Quiet fan - to not distract from a movie
    - Not super small - for reasons of heat mgmt
    - Better chips:
        - Better deinterlacing and scaling
    - HDMI / DVI inputs
    - Never have onboard audio
- Data
    - Bright - assume the room/office may be lit
    - Lower contrast
    - More fan noise
    - Onboard audio
    - Smaller (since they have a fan)
    - Lower res inputs (VGA, etc.)

## Criteria

### Aspect Ratio
- Basically, the shape of the rectangle
- 4:3 means '4 units of width for every 3 units of height'
- Not as simple as just selecting the ideal rectangle 
    - the problem is the content has it's own internal aspect ratio
- Common Projector Aspect Ratios
    - 4:3
        - AKA 1.33:1
        - More square than 16:9
        - Standard for
            - SD TV
            - Films prior to 1953
    - 16:9
        - AKA 1.78:1
        - Longer than 4:3
        - Standard for 
            - HDTV content
        - **most popular option**
    - 2.35:1
        - Super widescreen!
- Common Video Content Aspect Ratios
    - 1.33
    - 1.78
    - 1.85
    - 2.00
    - 2.35
    - 2.4
    - 2.5
    - The list goes on... **there's no standard?!**
- There are a variety of tradeoffs for each format but...
- **Short Version**: Get 16:9 unless you have a good reason 

### Resolution
- However many pixels it has to create an image
- Designated by one (1080p) or two numbers ( 1280x720 )
    - two numbers: horizontal by vertical
    - one number: the vertical
        - Sometimes followed by a 'p', meaning progressive (i.e. the entire picture is displayed at once)
- Common Resolutions:
    - 1280 x 720: older
    - 1280 x 800: good for computer and HD content
    - 1920 x 1080: great
- More resolution, more cost

### Brightness
- Illumination you percieve depends on 2 things:
    - light output of the Projector
    - reflective properties of the Screen
- 2 units of measurement:
    - **Ansi Lumen**: light energy being generated by the projector
    - **foot/Lamberts (fL)**: also factors in the screen characteristics, so less useful
- **Brighter is not better**
    - Too bright will produce eye fatigue!
- If the environment will have some ambient light, consider a brighter bulb at 20-40fL
- Check out the [Projection Calculator](http://www.projectorcentral.com/projection-calculator-pro.cfm) for more details

### Contrast
- The difference between brightest and darkest parts of an image
- This is the most important measurable characteristic in Video Projectors
- High contrast will give:
    - deep black level
    - nice shadow details
- 2 standard benchmarks:
    - On/Off Contrast: whitest white vs darkest black.  not super useful.
        - Dynamic Iris is a feature that will improve this score.  Basically, it makes the dark scenes darker and the converse.
    - Ansi Contrast: based on displaying a checkerboard.  more useful, but not great.
- Best to check reviews to get actual info on contrasts

### Installation details
- **Zoom Range**
    - Allows you to deliver the desired image size from a range of throw distances (i.e. distance from projector to image)
    - 1.2:1 lens means the max image size is 20% larger than the min 
    - Some provide 2.0:1 zoom range
    - Best to avoid the longest throw distance as this can result in much less brightness
- **Lens Shift**
    - Vertical and Horizontal Lens shift allow you to move the image based on the lens, rather than repositioning the camera
    - Common vertical lens shifts: 1 screen height to 3 screen heights

### Costs
- **Lamps**
    - Projector lamps have a finite life before they must be replaced.
    - Lamps are often rated with a maximum lifetime, which they might not actually achieve.
    - Can cost between $300-400
- **Screens**
    - Don't have to be replaced
    - Good ones are very nice, but a white wall is also fine

### Throw Ratio
- Throw Distance / Width of image
- The distance the camera needs away from the screen for each additional foot of width 
- A throw ratio of 2 means that for each foot of width, the projector needs to be 2 feet away

### Projector Types
- **DLP**



## Misc / Questions
- Connector
- Distance / Screen size
- Bulb replacement frequency / cost
- Projection Surfaces
- What is deinterlacing?
- What are the ambient lighting scenarios that need to be factored in?
