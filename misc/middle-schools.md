### Binford
- arts centric, partners with UR and art 180
- has honors classes for all subjects/grades

- has some coding classes in the calendar             

### Albert Hill
- We're zoned for this, but so is fox and a bunch of others
- has honors classes but the math doesn't seem to let you take above your grade level (unlike binford - but this might be a mistake)
- For 7th grade and up: National Junior Honor Society .  Requires community svc hours
- has sports teams incl track

### Lucile Brown
- IB
    - sounds academically rigorous, but unlike the IB Diploma program (hs), this teaches local curriculum with the IB learning philosophy, plus the requirement of a second language
    - think it may come down to how good the teachers are, class size, etc.
