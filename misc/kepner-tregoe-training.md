Kepner-Tregoe Training
=====================

## Notes from Chapters 1-2 of Book
- Teamwork is not an end.
    - It comes about by aligning thinking processes and focusing on common goals
- Specialization obscures common goals
- 4 patterns of thoughts (embodied by these questions):
    - What happened?
    - Why did it happen?
    - What should we do?
    - What will happen next?
- People will want to solve problems when they feel equipped, empowered, and encouraged to do so.
- Analysis Methodology
    - State the Problem
        - Should name the problem which you want to discover the cause of
        - Should be a clear deviation from the *SHOULD*
    - Specify the Problem in 4 Dimensions:
        1. What
        2. Where
        3. When
        4. Extent (Magnitude of Deviation)
    - For each dimension, clarify the closest basis of comparison where the deviation is not observed
        - This will help identify the cause
    - Formulate hypotheses utilizing
        - knowledge
        - experience
        - distinctions 
        - changes
    - Test possible causes
        - Physical tests, or just by further analysis
    - Identify a most likely cause
    - Confirm

## Kinds of Problems I usually deal with
- Shared strategic thinking with customers
- Local Problems w unknown causes (e.g. debugging)  <<-- Maybe this is appropriate?
- Execution of plans

## Questionnaire Notes
- What do I hope to achieve
    1. Common framework for analyzing a problem
    2. Common framework for thinking strategically across departments
    3. Better ability to articulate my own problem solving methodology
- Work concerns
    1. Technical debt is reducing output of developing new functionality

## Workshop Notes

### Situational Appraisal

1. Identify Concerns
    - Set scope
    - Taxonomy of concerns:
        - Deviations
        - Decisions
        - Plans
        - Changes
        - Threats
        - Opportunities
    - Clarify
        - What are the drivers?
        - Are there multiple issues?
        - Is this a symptom or a root cause?
        - You've factored them out if it can be resolved by a single analysis or action (even if you don't know what that is)
            - *I'm going to 'action' it*  =)
    - Create action statements for each item on the list
2. Set Priority
    - If everybody agrees, you can avoid the following process steps
    - Organize into groups:
        - Current Impact - cost
        - Future Impact - cost
        - TimeFrame - specifics on the time
    - For each group (CI, FI, TF) assign:
        - Low
        - Medium
        - High
        - You can also add a '+' or '-' for additional differentiation
    - Evaluate by group (column-wise) or a single concern across groups (row-wise)
3. Plan Next Steps
    - You need a noun and a verb
    - SOme things which might be neede:
        - Problem Analysis
        - Decision Analysis
        - More situation analysis (further clarification)
4. Plan Involvement
    - Who needs to do what by when

### Problem Analysis

- When to use Problem Analysis:
    - Define the deviation from 'should'
        - The deviation doesn't have to be negative
    - Is the cause unknown?
    - Do I need to know the cause to take effective action?
    - Yes to all 3: use Problem Analysis
- Steps:
    - State the problem:
        - What is the object? (one word)
        - What is the deviation? (one or two words)
    - Describe / Specify Problem (See questions and is/is not pairs)
    - Identify Possible Causes
    - Evaluate Possible Causes
    - Confirm True Case    
- Specify the Problem
    - What
    - Where
    - When
    - Extent
    - See the card
- Identify Possible Causes
    - Use knowlege or experience
    - Or Use distinctions and changes
        - Distinctions: things which are only true of the IS?
        - Changes: what changes related to distinctions?
- Evaluate Possible Causes
    - Test possible causes against each IS/IS Not pair:
        - If blah is the cause of the deviation, how does that explain both the IS and the IS NOT?
        - Each answer should be either:
            - Y : Yes, it explains both
            - N : No, it doesn't explain both
            - A : It only explains with assumptions being made
    - Pick the  possible cause with no N's and the fewest assumptions


- Comparison with normal method
    - PA is Focused on Information Gathering, Analysis
    - Normal (implicit) method is Focused on Testing:
        - Testing is comparatively cheap, so you only get as much information as is necessary to repro which is the crux of debugging / troubleshooting (?)



### PPP Process

- How to do meetings
- Purpose, Process, Payoff
- Purpose
    - Progress since last meeting
    - Review next actions ahead
    - Surface and action any concerns related to these actions
- Process
    - Systematically review each element of the purpose
- Payoff
    - Alignment on the next steps
