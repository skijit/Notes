Positive Discipline Notes
=====================

- Misc Notes from book/worksheet/class on Positive Discipline
- See [class photos from class](/misc/positive-discipline-class-photos)

## Chapter 1
- Children will listen to you AFTER they feel listened to
    - Don't lecture - be brief
    - Model respectful behavior when dealing with their feelings
- Instead of telling, **try asking**
    - Ask Curiosity Questions like...
        - What were you trying to accomplish?
        - How do you feel about what happened?
        - What did you learn from it?
        - What ideas do you have to help prevent this from happening again?
- Asking Vs Telling

| Telling | Asking |
| :---: | :---: |  
| Don't forget your coat  | What are you taking so you won't be cold outside? | 
| Do your hw | What is your plan for doing hw tonight?  |
| Stop whining | How can we communicate more respectfully?  |
| Pick up your toys | What is your responsibility when you're done playing with your toys?  |

- **Connection before Correction**
    - Kids can't learn when they feal threatened
    - Things like giving hugs when the child is misbehaving seem counter-intuitive, but it will encourage their desire to contribute and cooperate.
    

## Chapter 2
- Punishments and praise can be effective in stopping a behavior but they dont help children develop the internal motivation to learn and enact life skills.
    - Punishments involving withdrawl of love might lead to approval junkie
    - Overdoing praise will make the children entitled
- When kids misbehave this is a good chance to teach the life skills.  Punishments don't do that.
- Punishment => 3 R's in children (all bad)
    - Rebellion
        - => power struggle
    - Revenge
        - => getting even
    - Retreat
        - => low self-esteem or sneakiness
- 5 criteria for postive Discipline
    1. Kind but firm
    2. Foster Connection
    3. Long-term effectiveness
    4. Teach social / life skills
    5. Empower children, encourage to use it constructively
- Kind but firm
    - **Validate Feelings**
        - I know it is hard to stop playing, `AND` it is time for bed.
    - **Show understanding**
        - I can understand why you would rather watch TV than do you homework `AND` home needs to be done first.
    - **Redirection**
        - You don't want to brush your teesh `AND` we'll do it together.  Want to race?
    - **Agreement in advance**
        - I know you don't want to mow the lawn `AND` that was our agreement.
    - **As soon as...**
        - You don't want to go to be `AND` it is bedtime.  Want one story *as soon as* your pj's are on?
    - **A choice and then follow through by deciding what you will do**
        - I know you want to keep playing video games `AND` your time is up.  You can turn it of now, or it will be put in the closet.
- **You can't solve a problem at the time of conflict if either party is really upset**
    - taking time to cool off is a good life skill to learn
    - doesn't mean the kids get away with it
- **POSITIVE TIME OUT**
    - Have a nice place that parent and kid can go to cool down
    - Not punitive
    - Just take time to both be calm before talking about the problem
    - Ask if the kid wants to go there:
        - "Would it help you to go to your room?"
        - "Do you want me to with you?"
        - Model this behavior by going yourself

## Misc Notes From Meg Anne

- find ways to encourage the child to be driven by internal not external factors
- share stories of personal failures to destigmatize failure
    - emphasize how it is a necessary part of the learning process
- Sibling Fights and the 3'd B's in Positive Discipline
    - Beat it: The adult leaves the scene
    - Bear it: The adult looks at what the children are doing, without getting involved.
    - Boot them out: The adult separates the children from the scene.
    - **Point**: Let them sort it out but have clear boundaries if it escalates into unacceptable behaviors
- Dealing with potential lies:
    - "I'm gonna trust you"
    - Casually: "Is this real or not"
- Kids need a safe, private place to go when angry
- Narrating instead of reacting
    - Rather than matching the kids anger, say "I see you're angry..."
- The Flipped Lid
    - People can be rational once they've reached a certain state of anger/arousal
    - Do not engage with anger
    - Give them a choice to make (e.g. You can go here or you can go there...)
- Assessing kid's evaluation of social circumstances / dissapointments
    - Ask: "Are you ok with that?"

- Goals
    - Consistency with PD
    - Anger in family
    - Empathy in kids 

## Meeting 10-4

- Rewind
    - Rather than accepting the kids not listening to a request, back up the situation again.
    - Explain the situation.
    - Try again.
    - Ex. Getting into the car and strapping in
    - This is a good stopping in the moment
    - This is good for practicing when you have time

- One way to avoid rebellion is to emphasize that they are making choices
    - 'I'm going to respect your choice...'
    - Another thing is to make a connection: 'I see you want to do this...'

- To avoid the meaningless of 'you madeS this choice'... or making it just seem like a retroactive punishment instrument, try to frame the situation proactively: 
    - you can choose to do this thing I want or you can choose to do this crappy thing

- WRT Nina playing mean with Penny, have a talk with Penny and ask her what she's ok with.
    - Encourage her to see whether she plays with Nina as her choice, and review her options.
    - Facillitate her working it out with Nina on her own
    - Similarly, we don't get involved in the kids until they break our consent (i.e. what *we* are ok with)
    - Offer to play with Penny if Nina isn't being nice.
        - We're going to play nice with each other

## Meeting 10-11

- Emphasis on asking vs telling, esp. when making a connection bc of an angry kid and attempting to deal with their anger.
- Avoid the telling them to do stuff:
    - Ex: Cleaning X
        - Penny: can you help me keep a clean house
        - Nina: ask her to do it, but if she doesn't do it, i'll get praise from Jennifer
            - Effort praising remember
- Ask Nina what her goal is for a soccer game
    - Then you can talk about how she did in relation to that
- Regarding Nina and social circumstances : be a bridge and not a crutch.
    - interact with both her and her friends/teammates

## Meeting 10-25

- scenario: nina gets upset bc she wants a cookie.  we deal with her anger by saying, 'I see youre so angry bc you don't think this is fair'
    - validate their feelings - and leave it at that
    - this is different from saying you agree
- scenario: penny gets a 14 out of 15 on a worksheet and looses it
    - acknowledge her feelings
    - ask how she feels about the good parts of the worksheet
    - if she wants to write a note to a teacher, the teacher can talk about it (with more legitimacy)
- book: love languages
    - how you give love (act of service, words of affirmation, time, touch, gifts) is the kind of love you want to receive
    - encourage nina to offer that to other kids (think she's encouragement / attention)

## Meeting 11-1

- handling potty talk:
    - check consent
    - am i ok with the consequences
    - parameters: when is it ok, amonst whom

- netflix docs:
    - missrepresentation
    - the mask you live in
