Positive Discipline Notes
=====================

- Misc Notes from book/worksheet/class on Positive Discipline

## Chapter 1
- Children will listen to you AFTER they feel listened to
    - Don't lecture - be brief
    - Model respectful behavior when dealing with their feelings
- Instead of telling, **try asking**
    - Ask Curiosity Questions like...
        - What were you trying to accomplish?
        - How do you feel about what happened?
        - What did you learn from it?
        - What ideas do you have to help prevent this from happening again?
- Asking Vs Telling

| Telling | Asking |
| :---: | :---: |  
| Don't forget your coat  | What are you taking so you won't be cold outside? | 
| Do your hw | What is your plan for doing hw tonight?  |
| Stop whining | How can we communicate more respectfully?  |
| Pick up your toys | What is your responsibility when you're done playing with your toys?  |

- **Connection before Correction**
    - Kids can't learn when they feal threatened
    - Things like giving hugs when the child is misbehaving seem counter-intuitive, but it will encourage their desire to contribute and cooperate.
    

## Chapter 2
- Punishments and praise can be effective in stopping a behavior but they dont help children develop the internal motivation to learn and enact life skills.
    - Punishments involving withdrawl of love might lead to approval junkie
    - Overdoing praise will make the children entitled
- When kids misbehave this is a good chance to teach the life skills.  Punishments don't do that.
- Punishment => 3 R's in children (all bad)
    - Rebellion
        - => power struggle
    - Revenge
        - => getting even
    - Retreat
        - => low self-esteem or sneakiness
- 5 criteria for postive Discipline
    1. Kind but firm
    2. Foster Connection
    3. Long-term effectiveness
    4. Teach social / life skills
    5. Empower children, encourage to use it constructively
- Kind but firm
    - **Validate Feelings**
        - I know it is hard to stop playing, `AND` it is time for bed.
    - **Show understanding**
        - I can understand why you would rather watch TV than do you homework `AND` home needs to be done first.
    - **Redirection**
        - You don't want to brush your teesh `AND` we'll do it together.  Want to race?
    - **Agreement in advance**
        - I know you don't want to mow the lawn `AND` that was our agreement.
    - **As soon as...**
        - You don't want to go to be `AND` it is bedtime.  Want one story *as soon as* your pj's are on?
    - **A choice and then follow through by deciding what you will do**
        - I know you want to keep playing video games `AND` your time is up.  You can turn it of now, or it will be put in the closet.
- **You can't solve a problem at the time of conflict if either party is really upset**
    - taking time to cool off is a good life skill to learn
    - doesn't mean the kids get away with it
- **POSITIVE TIME OUT**
    - Have a nice place that parent and kid can go to cool down
    - Not punitive
    - Just take time to both be calm before talking about the problem
    - Ask if the kid wants to go there:
        - "Would it help you to go to your room?"
        - "Do you want me to with you?"
        - Model this behavior by going yourself
