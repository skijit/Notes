Generative Art
==============

## Lecture 1

- Generative Art: works of art that rely on an autonomous system for part or all of their production
    - not a movement or aesthetic
    - it's just a technique
    - doesn't require a computer

- Computational Creativity: the academic field devoted to the scientic study of computational processes for creative tasks
    - investigate creative processes as they are
        - can you understand, model, simulate it?
    - investigate creative processes as they could be
        - things we know humans can't do without machines
    - compare to AI:
        - AI typically focuses on *rational problems* where the notion of success and even optimality are well-defined and testable
        - *creative tasks* are where there are no *clear* best outcomes
            - e.g. there is no best musical piece
            - optimality is ill-defined
    - Metacreative systems: computational systems that produce or simulate creative processes
        - often evaluated on their methodologies
    - not always focused on creating artistic process (compare to generative art)

- Two Examples of Generative Art
    - Painting Program [Aaron](http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html)
    - The [Continuator](http://francoispachet.fr/continuator/continuator.html)
        - Listens to human and then tries to immitate and extend the human/style
        - Based on Markov Chains
    - David Cope's [EMI](http://artsites.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/experiments.htm) is very interesting, and worthy of more research.

- Elements of Creativity
    - Aristototelian Approach involves 3 dimensions
        - Analytic Intelligence
        - Practical Intelligence (knowledge)
        - Synthetic Intelligence (creative)
    - Typically refer to creating something new, novel, and valuable in a way that represents the creator
    - Boden defines two kinds of high-level creativity:
        - P-creativity
            - creating somethin valuable to the person.
        - H-creativity
            - something valuable for other people
    - Boden also defines 3 subtypes of creativity
        - Exploratory Creativity   
            - Creating things within a conceptual space
        - Combinatorial Creativity
            - Putting together 2 different conceptual spaces
        - Transformational Creativity
            - Changes the definition of the conceptual space

- Typology of Computational / Digital Creative Systems
    - Many different domains\tasks in which to operate
    - Some systems are very specific (more focused on a task, art) while others are more generic (e.g. style imitation) (more focused on the scientific aspects)
    - Autonomous vs Reactive
    - Low-level interactivity (system only reacts to input, aka reactivity) vs high level interactivity (agent interaction- requires two - bidirectional )
    - Realtime vs offline
    - Origin of knowledge:
        - Encoded (by author)
        - Input - parametric or data-driven
        - Learned - extracted from the Input
            - Corpus Based: Being exposed to sample works
    - Knowledge can be static or dynamic
    - 4 classes of behavior / output
        - fixed: converges to a static output
        - periodic: recurrent patterns of behavior
        - complex: somewhere between periodic and chaotic
        - chaotic: no discernable pattern
    - System Architectures
        - Generative: parameters/input -> generate -> output
        - Generative and evaluate: like above but adds an evaluative step in between
        - Generative with reflexive feedback: like above but involves a loop: parameters/input -> generate <-> evaluate -> output
            - brainstorm characteristics
                - go for quantity
                - withhold criticism
                - welcome wild ideas
                - combine and improve ideas
            - decoupling generative phase from the evaluative phase
        - Interactive and adaptive: has a feedback loop with it's environment

    - 40,000 BC: Cave painting, tools, woodcarving, etc.
    - 3,000 BC: language develops, enabling storytelling, poetry
- History of Generative Art
    - Any geometrical / rule-based pattern
    - Lots of rule-based systems
        - islamic art
    - Early machines
        - Based on energy sources:
            - Hydraulic Power -> water organs, basic automatons (al jazari)

    - SPRIROGRAPH!
    - Nake
- Delegating control in favor of a process
    - Common approach is to use chance or random operations
- Randomness and Noise
    - Randomness is observed in a sequence when order and pattern seems to be lacking
    - There used to be books full of random numbers!
    - Another technique is to measure any physical, entropic system
    - pseudorandom numbers are generated algorithmically: obviously deterministic, based on the seed (which itself is random)
    - Popular Probabalistic Distributions
        - Uniform : each option is equally likely
        - Bernoulli : when you have two possible outcomes.
            - Probs are P and 1-P
            - In flipping a coin, P = 0.5, but other P values are possible
        - Binomial: Probability of X successes in a series of N Success/Failure experiments.  
            - Similar to Bernoulli, but see how it involves more than one event
        - HyperGeometric: 
        - Poisson: models the number of times, K, a given event, X, occurs within a time interval.
            - If they're independent, then the rate is constant
            - Very useful in simulations
        - In max, `itable` is used for these distributions
        - Geometric: how many failures before a given outcome occurs in a series of trials.
    - When a distribution applies to a continuous variable, we call it a *Probability Density Function*
        - Gaussian / Normal
            - defined by it's mean and variance
    - When each element in a sequence is decided at random, we call it noise.
    - Lots of different kinds of noise:
        - We characterize the different kinds of noise based on the amount of correlation between the different values in the sequence.
        - White noise = no correlation
            - uniform distribution
        - `noisetilt` in Max will generate
            - 1d, 2d, 3d all possible
        - types of audio noise are distinguished by power distributions in spectrum
        - Brownian noise (aka Brown noise or red noise)
            - produced by Brownian motion
            - random walk noise
                - a sequence of steps in which each step is chosen randomly
            - less treble than white noise
            - frequency spectrum is ramp down from the lower frequencies
        - Pink Noise
            - Spectral Power is inversely proportional to the frequency buckets
            - very useful in generative art and simulation
            - many phenomena observe this kind of distribution (natural and synthetic)
            - see 1/f
        - Other kinds of noise:
            - Blue
            - Purple
            - Gray noise
        - Perlin noise:
            - developed for the movie Tron!
            - good for animation purposes and modelling of things like:
                - marble
                - smoke
                - terrain
                - flame
                - clothes
                - liquid
            - often introduced into geometric patterns to create variety in texture in graphics
            - TODO: add pictures of different kinds of noise
- Chance as a Generator
    - Aleatoric: process is defined in general, but the details are chance-driven
    - Mozart, Duchamp, Cage, Xenakkis
    - Formalized Music, Xenakkis (1971)
    - Jean Arp (painter- used randomness)
    - Ellsworth Kelly (painter- see spectrum colors arranged by chance)
- Two types of approaches
    - Combinatorial
    - Procedural
- Some purposes of Generative Art:
    - question intentionality
    - strategy for exploratory creativity
- Chaos and Fractals
    - Model dynamic systems
    - A dynamic system can converge to 1 of 4 behaviors:
        - Fixed Point behavior 
            - stable or unstable equilibrium
        - Periodic Behavior
        - Quasi-Periodic Behavior
        - Chaotic Behavior:
            - Can only be predicted in the short term
            - Very sensitive to initial conditions
            - Small changes in input can make the output different / hard to predict
            - Popularized by Lorenz
                - Coined the 'butteryfly effect' describing how the existing weather prediction formula / mechanisms could be affected (globally) by the incredibly small, local turbulences caused by a single butterflies flapping wings
            - Different from stochastic processes in that they're very deterministic
    - Fractals are chaotic system
        - have self similariy
        - patterns repeat themselves at different scales
            - siepinski gasket
        - mandelbroit set: it's a series formula with 2 variables:
            - for each combination of those variables, you test whether it's growth is bounded (covervges to infinity) or not, and draw that coordinate accordingly.
    - fractals occur all over the place in nature
    - in music, analagous to repetition and variation
        - xcomposer, fractmuse
    - Attractor
        - its a point (or sets of points) that a function will converge to after a range of conditions or infinite iterations
        - types of attractors:
            - single point attractor
            - periodic attractors
            - chaotic attractors, strange attractor
                - 

- Sample/Loop serial music
