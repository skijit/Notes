Generative Art
==============

- Generative Art: works of art that rely on an autonomous system for part or all of their production
    - not a movement or aesthetic
    - it's just a technique
    - doesn't require a computer

- Computational Creativity: the academic field devoted to the scientic study of computational processes for creative tasks
    - investigate creative processes as they are
        - can you understand, model, simulate it?
    - investigate creative processes as they could be
        - things we know humans can't do without machines
    - compare to AI:
        - AI typically focuses on *rational problems* where the notion of success and even optimality are well-defined and testable
        - *creative tasks* are where there are no *clear* best outcomes
            - e.g. there is no best musical piece
            - optimality is ill-defined
    - Metacreative systems: computational systems that produce or simulate creative processes
        - often evaluated on their methodologies
    - not always focused on creating artistic process (compare to generative art)

- Two Examples of Generative Art
    - Painting Program [Aaron](http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html)
    - The [Continuator](http://francoispachet.fr/continuator/continuator.html)
        - Listens to human and then tries to immitate and extend the human/style
        - Based on Markov Chains

- Elements of Creativity
    - Aristototelian Approach involves 3 dimensions
        - Analytic Intelligence
        - Practical Intelligence (knowledge)
        - Synthetic Intelligence (creative)
    - Typically refer to creating something new, novel, and valuable in a way that represents the creator
    - Boden defines two kinds of high-level creativity:
        - P-creativity
            - creating somethin valuable to the person.
        - H-creativity
            - something valuable for other people
    - Boden also defines 3 subtypes of creativity
        - Exploratory Creativity   
            - Creating things within a conceptual space
        - Combinatorial Creativity
            - Putting together 2 different conceptual spaces
        - Transformational Creativity
            - Changes the definition of the conceptual space

- Typology of Computational / Digital Creative Systems
    - Many different domains\tasks in which to operate
    - Some systems are very specific (more focused on a task, art) while others are more generic (e.g. style imitation) (more focused on the scientific aspects)
    - Autonomous vs Reactive
    - Low-level interactivity (system only reacts to input, aka reactivity) vs high level interactivity (agent interaction- requires two - bidirectional )
    - Realtime vs offline
    - Origin of knowledge:
        - Encoded (by author)
        - Input - parametric or data-driven
        - Learned - extracted from the Input
            - Corpus Based: Being exposed to sample works
    - Knowledge can be static or dynamic
    - 4 classes of behavior / output
        - fixed: converges to a static output
        - periodic: recurrent patterns of behavior
        - complex: somewhere between periodic and chaotic
        - chaotic: no discernable pattern
    - System Architectures
        - Generative: parameters/input -> generate -> output
        - Generative and evaluate: like above but adds an evaluative step in between
        - Generative with reflexive feedback: like above but involves a loop: parameters/input -> generate <-> evaluate -> output
            - brainstorm characteristics
                - go for quantity
                - withhold criticism
                - welcome wild ideas
                - combine and improve ideas
            - decoupling generative phase from the evaluative phase
        - Interactive and adaptive: has a feedback loop with it's environment
