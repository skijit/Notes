Creating Custom Triggers
======================

- Midi Triggers vs Piezo/Contact Mics
- Hardware vs Software solutions

- I don't want to buy a really expensive sound card, and I don't really need to have audio data.
- Maybe a good solution would be to add accelerometers to the sticks, send that via USB to an Arduino that has multiple inputs (for different sticks) and then it sends a midi out for each one.
