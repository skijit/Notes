Arduino Starter Kit
==============
- Notes collected from the starter kit materials

## Intro
- Simple way to think of arduino:
    - Sensors: Turn energy into electrical signals
    - Actuators: Turn signals into physical actions
    - Microcontrollers: Listen to sensors and talk to Actuators.
- You build custom circuits and interfaces for it and write code for it, to tell it what to do.

## Parts and Purposes
- Battery Snap
- Breadboard
    - Lets you build circuits
    - This kind doesn't require soldering, but some do
- Capacitors
    - Store and release electrical energy
    - If the voltage in the circuit is higher than what is stored, it allows current to flow in
    - If the voltage in the circuit is lower than what is stored, it releases it's stored charge
    - Often placed close to a sensor or motor to smooth out voltage fluctuations.
    - Examples:
    ![capacitors](/resources/images/programming/capacitors.jpg)
- DC motor
    - Coils of wire become magnetized when current flows through them, inducing it to spin
    - If the direction of electricity is reversed, the motor will spin in the opposite direction
- Diode
    - Makes sure electricity only flows in one direction
    - Semiconductor component
    - Sometimes you'll want the flow of electricity to be unidirectional
    - 2 sides (electrodes):
        - Cathode
            - marked with a band on its side
        - Anode
