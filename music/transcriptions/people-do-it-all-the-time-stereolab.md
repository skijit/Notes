**Phrase 1**

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| E | D | G | F |
| I | bVII | tr up 4th: I | bVII |

- I -> bVII always creates some ambiguity.  
- Resolves up a fourth, which is a new sound in E
- The logic becomes clear when it goes to F, beause its a harmonic 2-bar sequence repeated a fourth apart:
    - I -> bVII
    - I think this kind of device is often used in jazz... (e.g. a ii-V up a half-step)

**Phrase 2**

| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 
| :---: | :---: | | :---: | :---:  
| back to orig key: F#- B | C | F#- B | E |
| ii V | bVI |  ii V | I |

- You could view these as two separate phrases, but I keep them together to be consistent w/ phrase 1
- Like phrase 1, this is a 2 bar harmonic sequence where th first version is a deceptive cadence and the second is the real cadence
- ocassional elision on the last bar (so you don't get too much I on the turnaround)

**Other Notes**
- melody has the 7ths/leadtones
