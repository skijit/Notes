- 2 phrases
    - 1st: 4 bars
        - E => D : bVII creates some toal ambiguity which gets clarified with a nice V-I to a new key of G (soon)
        - D => G : this is like a bVII as a V, which takes us to the bIII.
        - Then since bIII is outside the key and we just had a V-I, we feel like we're in a new tonality of G
        - This makes F, as a bVII a good choice:
            - it's repetitive of the first two bars
            - creates an ambiguity in key, which makes it easy to slide up to the F#, ii-V
        - compare to fat old sun?
    - 2ns: last 4 bars
        - diatonic in nature
        - a deceptive ii-v to the bVII (make sure this is a legit move in notes)
        - then a repeate ii-v to the actual i

- there's a second ending version that involces after the last E, going to C then repeating the last ii-v, usually w ellipsis when landing on the E
- melody has the 7ths/leadtones

- occasional elipsis on the last bar (like the elliot smith move)
- can you always move down a whole step in major chords?
- add another trick: ii-V-bII, ii-V-I  (in addition to the ii-V-bVI)
- so what's interesting about the bVII
    - it can take us out of the key without putting us in something new
    - it's related to the original, but you can use it to modulate to a new key OR resolve to a chord in a new key (such as when you use it as a V of bIII).
