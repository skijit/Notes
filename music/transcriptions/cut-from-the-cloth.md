The Evens

## A Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| A- | D | F7 | C | 
| ii | V  | bVII7  | IV  | 

- The bVII7 we've seen before, but would expect it to go to the I (G)
    - This is the chord that 'asks the question' - sets some instability
- Instead it goes to the IV (C).  This works because:
    - The dom7 gives it some extra instability
    - F A C Eb is very close to C:
        - One common tone 
        - F and Eb both resolve by half-steps to the E
        - A resolves by a whole step (which is unremarkable, but the other notes matter more)
            - Since this A is the least important, you could also make this an F-7 and it would sound fine.
        - This is another resolution mechanism which I oughta document (we'll call it 'chord distance')
        - Probably when you have something that is diatonic or a common target, and it's got a small chord distance, that makes it a good candidate
- A- to F7 is a familiar sound:
    - minor key, down a M3
    - You could take it a half step further for a std cadence: (A, F7, E7)
    - You can also toggle back and forth like Nirvana's 'Something in the Way': E-, C
    - 2 out of 3 notes are the same so it's a common tone sub
- F7 to C:
    - You could go F, G(7), C but that's "too many words"
        - Tonality is already implied, so the V-I is really just blah    - Another option in a similar resolution would be the A-, but we've already been there

## B Section 

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: | 
| A- | D7 | D-7 | D-6 | A- |
| i | IV | iv | iv6 | i |

- Does the usual IV to iv then uses the D-6 which implies G7 which could resolve to a bunch of stuff, but A- makes sense since that's where we started.

## C Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A- | D | A | D | E- | E- | E- | E- |
| i | IV | i | IV | v | v | v | v |

- I wonder how often you have consecutive chords with NO shared tones between them?
