The Evens

- A- / D / F7 / C
- A- / D7 / D-7 / D-6 / A-
- A- D / E- E / 

- A- to F7 is a familiar sound:
    - minor key, down a M3
    - You could take it a half step further for a std cadence: (A, F7, E7)
    - You can also toggle back and forth like Nirvana's 'Something in the Way': E-, C
    - 2 out of 3 notes are the same so it's a common tone sub
- F7 to C:
    - You could go F, G(7), C but that's "too many words"
        - Tonality is already implied, so the V-I is really just blah
    - 

- I wonder how often you have consecutive chords with NO shared tones between them?
