Esther Transcription Notes
====================

## SECTION A

![esther section a transcription](/resources/docs/music/esther-sec-a.png)

### Phrase 1: 
- Length: 5 bars (1-5)
- Starts D (I), Ends G (IV)
- Progression: I - I - iii - bVII - IV
- The bVII is like a IV of the G, so it has a plagal cadence / suspensiony sound that works even though it's not diatonic or a secondary V
    - secondary IV's seems to work nicely
- Nice descending line of D. Db, C, B
- The iii chord *unsettles* the I and the bVII helps take us to IV  
    - **Question**: Is this a common theme- have one chord unsettle the stability and then help us get to the target?
        - Or is this just a passing chord?

### Intersection of Phrase 1 and 2:
- Separated, but a quality change as IV => iv

### Phrase 2:
- Length 5 bars (5-9)
- Starts G- (iv), Ends D (I)
- If you include the last chord of phrase 1, you get a repeat IV-iv-I, IV-iv-I

### Intersection of Phrase 2 and 3:
- Elided on the I

### Phrase 3:
- Length 4 bars
- Starts D (I), Ends A (V)
- I-IV-#IVo-V
- Takes us to the V

### Intersection of Phrase 3 and 4:
- Separted, but a lengthening relationship as V => V7

### Phrase 4:
- Length 4 bars
- Basically a long cadence back to the I, but in this case, we go to the i
- V7 - I - V - i

### Grouping
- Phrase Harmony:
    - Phrase 1-2:
        - I - IV - ... (iv) ... - I
        - Resolutions to I are from IV only    
    - Phase 3-4:
        - Basically I - V - I
        - Resolution to I are from V only
- Phrase Length:
    - The only elided phrase is between 2-3, against the natural harmonic grouping

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Pretty much 1 chord per bar

### Harmonic Repetitions
- IV-iv-I repeated twice, overlapping phrases 2 and 3 

### Histogram
- Over 17 bars
    - I or i :  6
    - IV:       3
    - V or V7:  3
    - iii:      1
    - iv:       2
    - bVII:     1
    - #IVo:     1

## Section B

![esther section b transcription](/resources/docs/music/esther-sec-b.png)

### Intersection of Section A and B
- Section A starts D maj and ends D min.  Then section B picks up at D-'s relative major: F.

### Phrase 1
- Length: 4 bars
- I - Iaug - I6 - I7
- Functionally: V of IV 
- Lengthens the I sound by walking up from the 5th scale degree (the major equivalent of Bond)

### Intesection of Phrase 1 & 2
- V of IV => IV

### Phrase 2
- Length: 4 bars
- IV - iv - I - I
- Functionally: takes us from IV back home with a plagal cadence

### Intersection of Phrase 2 & 3
I => V

### Phrase 3
- Length: 8 bars
- V - V - I - I - ii - ii - V - V
- Functionally: V
- **Second Rep**: Replaces the ending V with a ii-V in a new key: Ab
    - Up a m3: This is a legit key change
        - If we we modulated to G, we'd be hitting a lot of the same chord/roots
        - Ab has 4 of the same notes a F

### Histogram
- Over the 16 bars:
    - I :   8
    - V:    4
    - ii:   2
    - IV:   1
    - iv:   1

### Repetitions
- None

## Section C

![esther section c transcription](/resources/docs/music/esther-sec-c.png)

### Phrase 1
- Length: 4 bars
- I - #Io - ii - V

### Intersection of Phrase 1 & 2
- Instead of the V of Phrase 1 resolving to a I, we go back to IV
    - By not going to I, we can return back to V and extend that V sound

### Phrase 2
- Length: 4 bars
- IV - IV - V - V

### Histogram
- Over the 8 bars:
    - V:    3
    - IV:   2
    - I:    1
    - #Io:  1
    - ii:   1

## Section D

![esther section d transcription](/resources/docs/music/esther-sec-d.png)

### Intersection of Section C and D
- Recall the basic point of sec. C was to create a V sound.  That sets up a strong expectation of returning to I, but instead, it's modulates to the key of E (a half step up from the V root!)

### Phrase 1
- Length: 20 bars
- Melodic phrases are broken up in 4 bars
- I (x4) - i (x4) - ii (x4) - II (x4) - V
- Good for solos:
    - harmonic rhythm is slower
    - lots of root movement in 4ths
    - final chord is a V, so there's a nice resolution with each repeat 
- i =>  ii : since the i is dorian, you could also see this as a ii => iii
- ii => II : the ultimate destination is to the V, and the II is just a V of V, so that's ok
