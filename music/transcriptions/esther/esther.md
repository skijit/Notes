Esther Transcription Notes
====================

## SECTION A

### Phrase 1: 
    - Length: 5 bars (1-5)
    - Starts D (I), Ends G (IV)
    - Progression: I | I | iii | bVII | IV
    - The bVII is like a IV of the G, so it has a plagal cadence / suspensiony sound that works even though it's not diatonic or a secondary V
        - secondary IV's seems to work nicely
    - Nice descending line of D. Db, C, B
    - The iii chord *unsettles* the I and the bVII helps take us to IV  
        - **Question**: Is this a common theme- have one chord unsettle the stability and then help us get to the target?

### Phrase 2:
    - Length 4 bars (5-9)
    - Starts G- (iv), Ends G-
