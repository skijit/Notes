- Transcription of song by Broken Bells
- 3 parts and 6 total chords: he gets a lot of mileage out of this pallete
- In all sections he uses a similar resolution pattern with the F->G-
    - Either resolving to the expected target (A-) or a deceptive one
- The most important chords are: A- , E-, D, F (i, v, IV, bVI)
    - The C is a sub for i
    - The G (bVII) is the same sound as the E- (v)
        - That seems to work esp well when you have a minor i and v 
        - TODO: Make sure this is added to the list of useful things the bVII can do
- As usual with Broken Bell's, lots of diatonic stepwise root movement: D->C, F->G->A
- The F always leads into a G
