The Ghost Inside
=======
- Broken Bells

## Section A

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| E- | E- | D | A |
| i | i | bVII | IV |

- The bVII asks the question and moving to IV is a safe target for resolving back to the IV
- The bVII usually seems to go to the IV.  They're close together and the bVII is a IV of the IV, so you create a smooth resolving sequence.
    - See Esther

## Section B

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| A- | A- | D | D | E- | E- | E- | E- |
| iv | iv | bVII | bVII | i | i | i | i |

- Good transition for a bridge is to take the existing chord and change the quality
    - Also a IV-iv transition
- Elision on transitioning back to the A section: The E- just begins the form for the A section
