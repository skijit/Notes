- Entire song is in Eb maj / Cmin, with a picardy third resolution
- notation below is relative to the major tonality, which is kinda wrong but easy

**Phrase 1**

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| C- | C- F- | G- | G- |
| rel to I |  |  |  |
| vi | vi ii | iii | iii |
| rel to i |  |  |  |
| i | i iv | v | v |


- vi - (iii -> V)
- the F- is just a quick passing note

&nbsp;

**Phrase 2**

| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Bb | Bb (7) | C | C |
| rel to I |  |  |  |
| V | V | VI | VI |
| rel to i |  |  |  |
| bVII | bVII | I | I |

- V - (I -> i)
- The V could be thought of 2 ways:
    - A V of the I (Eb maj), suggesting resolution to I (probably less accurate)
    - A bVII of the vi (C-), making it a bVII -> VI resolution (not the picardy third) (probably more accurate)
- Another way of seeing this: 
    - We start off in the key of C-.  
    - We get to the v, but anytime you have a v7 (which is what the bVII implies), you can step up a 4th (G- -> C)
