- A: D / Bb G / D / Bb G / D / F / A
- B: G D / A D / G D / F A 
- C: B- / D / G A / G A

A:
- Starting in D (I)
- I to IV movement with a passing chord which makes it interesting
    - the passing chord works bc of shared tones and making a nice line
        - the Maj triad down a M3 is often nice (see below)
    - root movement is symmetrical
    - shared note of D between the D, Bb, and G
    - The starting note in the melody is an F, (m3) which anticipates the Bb
    - 
- Given a D:
    - Down M3: Bb - has shared tone and makes a nice passing chord (e.g. to IV)
    - Down m3: B- substitution for D
    - Up m3: F - has shared tone and makes a nice passing chord (e.g to V)
    - Up M3: F# - substituion for D


B:
- Classic Bridge section is to get a V, but instead of going to I, go to IV
    - The bridge repeat even uses this same resolution
- Role reversal:
    - So the I is like the V to the IV
    - The A is like a secondary dom, so we get 2 fifths here: A - D - G
        - V - I - IV
- The second half is a slight reordering so that we can land on A
    - The F the same passing chord we've to get from D to A


C:
- uses the rel minor substitution, then just a I/IV/V

Essentially:
D, Bb, G
D, F, A
similar idea: passing chords taking you to the place we get a nice resolution
