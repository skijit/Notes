## A Section
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | C | G | F#- | F | E |

- a simpler version might be: A, A-, G, D, F, E-
    - or A, E-, 
- some thoughts on this type of resolution: v => I
    - sounds like a bVII => I (add this to my list of reasonable resolutions to I.  Seems a little weaker sounding that minor plagal)
- g is a bVII and instead of it being a secondary IV to D, it resolve to F#- which is like the iii of D.
    - bVII => IV stronger resolution
    - bVII => vi not as strong, but the vi is like a minor sub for the I
        (add this as another type of phrase: static but moves to rel minor)
- harmonic phrasing is a 4 bar phrase with an added 2 bars at the end
    - 1-4: I => vi
        - I - bIII - bVII - vi
        - function: to rel minor
    - 5-6: bVI => v
        - the bVI (neapolitan?) generally has a predominant function
        - the v sets up a resolution on repeat
        - since its a minor v, it's not as strong, but closer in strength of resolution to the bVII - I cadence (and basically the same harmonically)
        - notice the similarity between C (2nd chord) and E- (last chord)
- purpose of the bIII: 
    - a secondary IV of the bVII
    - can substitute for a v - I cadence, only one note difference
        - also can probably be used to lengthen that cadence, like the sally's song/summertime thingy

- B section
    - like the A section for the first two but then instead of going from bIII to bVII (which is a plagal), it uses the V of bVII to give a stronger resolution... so from the perspective of the target bVII, it uses the IV, and then V.
    - the last two bars are basically the same as A since the v - I resolution is basically the same as a bIII - I resolution (C: C E G vs E-: B E G)


- TODO:
- do a melodic analysis too
- from way before: add note about the lengthening cadence V - bVI - V in summertime, similar to sally's song
- compare greendolphin street to d section of ester
- I think the sally's song B - make sure it is a b9
