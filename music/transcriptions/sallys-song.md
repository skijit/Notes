## Resolutions to i
- V (B)
- bII (F)

## Phrase 1
- Length: 4, Bars 1-4
- Start/End: i => i
- Function: tonic, establish phrygian tonality
- i - bII - V - i

## Intersection of Phrase 1 & 2
- Phrase 2 is basically the same as 1, except the first i is subbed out for the relative major chord, III.
- This lets it explore a new sound while still staying similar to the original

## Phrase 2
- Length: 4, Bars 6-9
- Start/End: III => i 
- Function: tonic, reiteration of the phrase 1 but sub the initial i with the relative major
- III - bII - V - i

## Phrase 3
- Length: 2, Bars 11-12
- Start/End: III => bII
- Function: subdominant, starts like previous phrase but ends unresolved on the #II
- III - bII

## Intersection of phrase 2 & 3
- First instance of a #II => i cadence.  Up until this point, we've just had strong V => cadences

## Phrase 4
- Length: 4, bars 13-16
- Start/End: i => bII
- Function: another subdominant phrase, like before, this time landing on the bII by way of a bVI
- i - V - bVI - bII

## Phrase 5
- Length: 5, bars 17-21
- Start/End: i => i
- Function: tonic.  has a strong V-i cadence with a bVI thrown in the middle
- i - V - bVI - V - i

## Summary
- Starts by establishing a Phrgyian tonality (naturally E phryg)
- Two types of cadences:
    1. V => i : takes us out of phrygian, but this is necessary for satisfying resolution
    2. bII => i : this is like a subdom cadence and it stays in phrygian.
        - Or you could see it as a tritone sub of the V, which is diatonic to phrygian, but since it sometimes leads to a V, and the resolution is a little less strong, I think of it as a subdom.
- Histogram
    - E- : 7.5
    - F : 5
    - B : 4
    - C : 2.5
    - G : 2
    - **So**: Aside from using the minor sound, it really reinforces the phrygian-ness and the pseudo-plagal cadence.
    - Interesting how this song sounds so *minor*, yet it only has 1 minor chord!  
        - Is this economy of minor intentional?
        - Do minor chord tonalities compete with each other? 
- Phrases:
    - First two are tonic, with a little relative major sub to keep it fresh, and V-I cadences
    - Next two are subdominant, ending unresolved on the bII
    - Last is tonic, with a strong V-I cadence
- Utility of the C and F
    - So, the function of the E-, B, and G is all really obvious.
    - The C has two functions:
        1. Predominant (maybe a little like an Aug 6 chord) 
            - root movement is a HALF-STEP.
        2. VI, leading to the bII
            - root movement is a FOURTH
    - The F has 2 functions also:
        1. Predominant
            - root movement is a FOURTH
        2. Subdominant
            - root movement back to i is a HALF-STEP
