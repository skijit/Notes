- Melody has a pickup bar, still on A
- The C is the most interesting chord here
    - It's a passing chord between the A and the E
    - All major chords and stepping down in root motions of M3
    - The E is constant throughout this, I think that's part of why it works
        - If you're trying to connect two chords which have a common tone, try a passing chord that also shares that tone.
    - Vaguely reminds me of Caetano Veloso's *Irene* which keeps a F pedal for: F, Db, Bb, F
        - Same thing in a Section Young Pilgrims by the Shins
        - The root movement sketches out a minor tria
        - These are all similar: and it sounds best when you pedal on the common tone
