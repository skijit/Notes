**A**

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| E | D | G | F |
| I | bVII | tr up 4th: I | bVII |

- I -> bVII always creates some ambiguity.  
- Resolves up a fourth, which is a new sound in E
- The logic becomes clear when it goes to F, beause its a harmonic 2-bar sequence repeated a fourth apart:
    - I -> bVII
    - I think this kind of device is often used in jazz... (e.g. a ii-V up a half-step)
