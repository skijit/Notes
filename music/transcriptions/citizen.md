- From Broken Bells

- A: C / G / C / G/ F / A- G
- B: Ab / G/ F
- C: Ab / Bb / Ab / Bb / Ab / Bb / C
- A': C / G / C / G/ F / A- G
- Eb / F- / G- / F- / Eb F- / Db / Ab (or F-?)

A:
- Move to a IV, then a vi-V resolution expected (and this is cool bc its just a vi-ii-V without the ii) but we get the Ab.

B:
- Cool that we keep resolving to the IV (F) instead of C.
    - Gives a feeling of incompleteness
    - The subdom is a BIG space in a tonality.  Why not hang out there?
- The Ab is like a sub for C (C, G, F)
    - Also chromatic, because at least it implies F-
    - Since it's a sub, it also gives the impression of instability but familiarity

C:
- The C section is about getting back to I (C)
    - The Bb is like a sub for G-
    - Alternately, he could have used a Db or just a G-, but this creates the nicest root movement
