Citizen Chord Changes
======================
- From Broken Bells
- Song has some interesting key changes, substitutions
- Marked by a lot of diatonic step-wise root movement

## A Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| C | G | C | G | C | G | F | A- G |
| I | V | I | V | I | V | IV | vi V |

- Move to a IV, then a vi-V resolution back to I is expected BUT then we get a key change
    - vi-V resolution:
        - has the diatonic stepwise motion so common in this tune
        - its just the usual vi-ii-V without the ii but we get the Ab.

## B Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ab | G | F | F |

- Key change to F is nice especially because it starts with a strong chromatic Ab and we don't really know where it's going until it rests on F, only to repeat and reinforce

## C Section
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ab | Bb | Ab | Bb | Ab | Bb | C | C |

- Begins sounding like the B section, but then moves to the Bb.  Then it vacillates between these two chords until it comes to rest on the C, which is a familar tonal center (from the A section.)
- Not suprisinly, then we go to back to the A secion.

## D Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Eb | F- | G-  | F- | Eb | F- | Db  | F-  |

## Form
