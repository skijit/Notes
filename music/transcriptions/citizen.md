Citizen Chord Changes
======================
- From Broken Bells
- Song has some interesting key changes, substitutions
- Marked by a lot of diatonic step-wise root movement

## A Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| C | G | C | G | C | G | F | A- G |
| I | V | I | V | I | V | IV | vi V |

- Move to a IV, then a vi-V resolution back to I is expected BUT then we get a key change
    - vi-V resolution:
        - has the diatonic stepwise motion so common in this tune
        - its just the usual vi-ii-V without the ii but we get the Ab.        
- The resolution to Ab (next works well) because it ends on V and we're expecting the I again.
    - So this is an excellent location for a deceptive cadence.
    - The Ab is just a substitution for a C- (invoking the parallel minor key)
- The IV just invites a question (what now?) that is then answered by the vi V and then the deceptive cadence

## B Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ab | G | F | F |

- I'm tempted to say this is a key change to F, but actually, it still seems like we're in C- (parallel minor) and just resolving to the IV.
    - Centering around the IV is a good technique in a B section.
    - Technically, the IV should be an iv if we're in C-, but playing around with parallel minor and chord qualities seems to work well.  Especially when you make a minor into a major.
- Another reason this makes sense is that we just played: F, A-, G With the suggestion that F could be the destination.  Ab, G, F sounds familiar.
    - It's good that we're avoiding C on the way to F.
- Other options to get to a IV:
    - Db, C, F
    - D, F#-, F
    - Bb/D, Db, F
        - In this case, replace the preceding A-, G, with a B-.



## C Section
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Ab | Bb | Ab | Bb | Ab | Bb | C | C |

- Begins sounding like the B section, but then moves to the Bb.  Then it vacillates between these two chords until it comes to rest on the C, which is a familar tonal center (from the A section.)
- Not suprisingly, then we go to back to the A secion.

## D Section

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Eb | F- | G-  | F- | Eb | F- | Db  | F-  |

- Not sure whether the Db should be thought of as a sub for the G- since then it just repeats OR if the Db is a sub for the F- (by common tones)

## Form
- A, Bx4, C, A, D
