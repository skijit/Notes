## Verse

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

- Harmonic Phrases:
    - 2 of 8 bars
    1. i - III - VI - #VI - VII
        - About the F
            - A bVII !  And like most/all bVII's, it's a secondary IV, resolving to the iv (or IV)  
        - About the Eb:
            - Has 2 great uses:
                1. Use a passing chord (#VI) to step into VII  OR
                2. Resolve back down to the i (the root becomes the 5th in the i)
    2. iv - i - ii0 - V
        - Set up a strong V-i resolution

- Melodic Phrases:
    - 4 of 4 bars
    - Symmetry in Phrases   
    - phrase 1 & 4 starts on the 2
    - phrase 2 & 3 starts on the 1 (or as a pickup)


## Chorus

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| G- | Bb | Eb | G- |
|||||
| Eb | G- | D  | D |
|||||

- 8 bar phrase repeated twice with an elision on first/last chord
- This works nicely bc the song is in 3 and the harmonic rhythm doubles from the verse

## Bridge

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| C- | C- | Eb | Eb |
|||||
| Bb | F  | G- | G- |
|||||
| C- | C- | Eb | Eb (Fermata) |
|||||

- Classic pop song bridge centered on the iv
- mirrors the i-III-bVII-IV progression in the verse, but starting at the iv to get land on F (the i's bVII).
    - kinda like a deceptive cadence - since instead of a strong V resolution to Bb, it goes to G-

## Misc
- Are there any non-diatonic harmonic surprises?
