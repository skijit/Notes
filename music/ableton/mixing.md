Mixing
==============

- Workflow
    - Incremental Mixing (manipulate dynamics, panorama, & frequency content on track-level)
    - Mixdown (bounce multiple tracks into stems and repeat previous process)
    - Mastering

    - He has created a new live set with his song, but he's divided everything into groups (eg hat, snare, percussion)
    - He suggests no more than 8 groups
    - Non-commital effects can be added to sends so that you can still change them later on
    - He sets the loop and highlights all of that region and then selects "export audio".  bit depth stays at 32, dithering off (you can only dither once, and that will happen later)
    - He also highlights the particular track (group) that he wants to export
    - Then he creates a new live set with 8 audio tracks and each one is going to host one stem.  He drops each stem into the arrangement view.
    - He suggests make the tempo the same tempo as the original song tempo (make sure warp is set to 'off')
    - Your stems need to have lots of headroom (but how much?)
    - When doing a mix, drag the mixer section as big as it can be and you can view the db markings

    - Do not exceed -6db on master
    - mix it on quiet- of course it will sound good loud- but it'll be great if you can make it sound good quiet
    - cut everything below 30Hz down by 5-6 Db - so not an entire cut, but these generally are too low for sound systems
    - think about what you want to make mono- as this can be a center in the song (kick drums can often be mono)

    - use lots of high pass filters to cut bass from instruments that don't need it.
    - he suggests looking at what frequencies to boost in certain parts, and to remove that band entirely from other parts w/ competing frequency content
    - take out extreme highs if they're not necessary- although remember the high freqs are really important to the presence of an instrument

- [Source](http://www.musicsoftwaretraining.com/blog/eqs-and-separation/)
    - if you have competing frequencies, you can also change their image in the panorama to resolve the conflict (as opposed to eq)
    - Use a highpass Filter (cut the lows) at around 120hz on every instrument besides the kick and bass sounds. This will greatly improve the clarity in the lower frequencies.
    - Cut frequencies between 350hz-550hz on any instruments that sound a bit muddy
    - Selectively use a lowpass filter (cut the highs) at around 10khz to leave room for clarity in the cymbals.
    - A little boost at 11.1khz can add nice clarity to your hi-hats
    - apply different reverbs to different parts to space out the mix a bit

    - Pick the instruments or tracks that you really want to stand out, boost the highs to make these sound clear, and soften out the EQ on other tracks.
    - Dont over-boost!  If you boost something by 12dB would a better idea be to boost the volume and then apply a different filter?

    - Mid/Side : m/s - the eq is different for stuff panned center vs stuff panned to the side
 
- [Source](http://www.joshuacasper.com/ableton-tutorials/ableton-tutorial-mixing-mastering-eq-8-scale-parameter/)
    - Scale button in EQ8: increases the min/max values in the eq curve
 
- [Source](http://blip.tv/the-ableton-cookbook/mid-side-eq-4405256)
    - Mid/Side EQ'ing: easier to approx batch volume based on panning
    - A lot of dance music places drums in the center, so you can do it differently
    - To get stuff in the center with Utility: set width to 0.  s
    - To get stuff in the sides with Utility: set width to 200%
    - Put higher frequencies in the sides and then do a m/s and give them boosts in the freqs
    - Long Reverb tails can live happily in the sides
    - Do not pan bass stuff far on the sides or it'll get muddy

    - To find the key frequencies of a sound, put a steep boost, narrow q, on the track and sweep till you hear the biggest impact.  now you know.
    - The qualities that make an instrument sound fantastic solo, are often the ones that make it hardest to polish in a full mix
    - To keep your eq'ing subtle: Cut Narrow, Boost Wide
    - First instinct should be to cut unnecessary stuff, rather than to boost	
    - For parts of the mix that sit in the same range:
        - boost and cut corresponding regions to make them play nice
        - consider a different panning arrangement to make them separate

    - Dynamics or EQ first? 
        - Build sound, then pack it in : EQ then compress (this is the standard)
        - tighten sound, and then showcase a few pieces: compress then EQ

- Utility vs Mixer:
	- Automate relative volume (between tracks) using utility and then when you need to bring total gain down, use the mixer

- From *Soundcoach*:
	- **MIX IN MONO**
        - Listen to your mix in Mono to detect phase issues (ie cancellation between channels... any cancellation within a channel isn't addressed/youre already screwed (but hopefully you hear the problem))
            - [phase issues will mostly need to be detected by ear](http://music.tutsplus.com/tutorials/fixing-phase--cms-19988)
            - [also try using this device to detect phase issues](http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/1363/simple-rms-meter)
        - Set the gains in the tracks to keep things relatively flat.  You'll do marco editing with the track's actual faders.
        - Put a high pass filter on everything but basses and kick drums to remove rumble:
            - Solo out the channel, move the cutoff freq right until you hear a change and then move the cutoff right before that
        - Muddiness: Listen for areas that have a lot of 200-400 hz (G3-G4) content and cut it a couple db using an EQ
        - Watch out for pain-freq (2 khz)- might need to cut a little of that
        - Complementary EQ your kick and bass: figure out which will provide the sub-bass: EQ a slight boost around 80hz and a slight cut at 110 hz and then do the opposite for the instrument that doesn't provide the sub-bass
        - Alternately, you can sidechain compress the bass to the drum

- Best way to A/B:  Bounce to audio to the two options, then normalize. [Source](https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=213567)

- Compression and EQ:
    - Compression is going to be triggered primarily by peaks in the music
