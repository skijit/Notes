Dynamics Processing
===================

- **Big Picture**:
	- Mixing / Sound design is going to involve manipulation of 3 things:
	    1. Frequency Content
	    2.  Volume Content
	    3. Stereo Panorama
	- Dynamics Processing only addresses Volume Content.
	- The point of Dynamic Range compression is not of information compression (like image or audio compression codecs/formats, like jpeg, mp3, etc.) to reduce the total amount of bits.  The point is the acoustic/musical impact that compressing the dynamic range has (and what applying it, lets you do later on that could not have done otherwise).
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- **Recall**:
	- Given a waveform, the horizontal axis relates to frequency and the vertical axis relates to volume.
	- Although the waveform will have crests and troughs, the volume is based on the overall distance from crest to trough.
	- SO: 
		- volume peaks are only positive- there are no negative peaks corresponding to waveform troughs
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- **Peaks vs Transients**:
	- Transients refer to the beginning of an acoustic event- usually the attack phase of some sound.  
	- Transients in Ableton correspond to zero crossing immediately preceeding the transient.
	- Peak is like a relative maximum in the volume.  Or it can be any high point which exceeds a threshold.
	- Transients often result in peaks, but you can also have peaks that don't correspond to transients. 
		- Example: a swell in an existing sound could exceed a threshold, but it wouldn't be related to a transient.

- **Compression**
	- Reduces Dynamic Range
		- Downward Compression:   LOWERS the volume of signals which EXCEED a threshold.
			- Might Reduce Peaks
		- Upward Compression:		RAISES the volume of signals BELOW a threshold.
			- Leaves Peaks intact
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- **Expanded**:
	- Increases Dynamic Range
		- Downward Expansion:	LOWERS the volume of signals BELOW a threshold.
		- Upward Expansion:	RAISES the volume of signals ABOVE a threshold.
			- Basically a Peak GRower
	- Downward Expansion is how Live's Gate works (which just completely drops quiet sounds, which might be good for removing low level noise)
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- **Use Cases**:
	- Downward Compression:
		- Most Common varieties...
		- De-essing (and applied only to isolated high-frequency content)
	- Upward Compression:
		- NY Compression
		- Parallel Compression: uncompressed dry signal mixed back into downward compressed one
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
- More Specifics:
	- Just google the transfer curves for compresor/expanders and you'll see the difference.  (or see references below)
