Ableton Live Looping 
================

- I'm taking a broad approach to "Live Looping" such that it can include sequencing methods (e.g. programming step sequencers) as well as the traditional live looper methods.
- There are a lot of ways to do this, with various tradeoffs.

## Tradeoffs
- Latency
    - Delay between the "recording" and playback
    - Any Audio-based method is going to be subject to Round-Trip Latency (RTL) (unless you use your interface's Monitoring capabilities- which seems a little dubious)    
- Recording Type
    - Audio
    - MIDI
- Recording Style
    - Realtime
    - Sequenced
- Record automation
- Note (Un)Quantization
- Loop
    - Length (Un)Quantization
    - Launch (Un)Quantization    
- Containers
    - Clip
    - Devices
        - Looper
        - Sampler
- Playback Flexibility
    - Apply effects
        - MIDI
        - Audio
    - Temporarily Add/Remove note(s)
    - Control playhead
        - Skip
        - Stutter
        - Reverse
    - Change Loop Region
    - Tempo changes
    - Mix between other clips/loopers?
    - Change automation
- Controllers
    - Computer keyboard
    - MIDI Keyboard
    - Push
        - Convenient MIDI Looping 
            - configurable/(un)quantized Length
            - duplication material w/o interrupting playback
            - overdub easy
        - Convenient Sample Navigation
        - Convenient Overall Live Set Navigation and Idea Creation
            - Including changing parameters for VST's
        - Are there conflicts with Midi Keyboards?
            - Looks like 'no' based on a somewhat cryptic forum post.
            - Since the loop endpoint buttons are probably not sending MIDI messages, and I can probably set MIDI in to 'ALL', I'm guessing it will be ok.
    - Any unique functionality?
