Thoughts on Chord Progressions
=========================

## Chord Progression
- A series of chords which may be repeated over the form of the piece
- The purpose of a chord progression might include:
    - Supporting other components of the piece
    - Contributing to the character of the piece     
    - Capturing the attention of the listener
    - Creating a musical expectation and perhaps defying it

## Home Chord
- In tonal music, the listener will generally identify one chord/sound, the **Home Chord**, as the most important:
    - It is where the music wants to end, and often where the music starts         
    - It is the chord which is the most central and stable to the piece
    - In longer progressions, it is often the most frequently played chord
- The Home Chord could be the same as the Tonic in functional harmony, but sometimes the Home Chord will not strictly be a I.  It could be a I7, Isus, or any other quality chord.
- Static Music employs only one characteristic harmony
    - There is no chord *progression*, since it's only one chord
    - This chord is still a Home Chord, since it is stable, creates expectation, etc.  
- In contrast, music with chord progressions
    - Will have one (or possibly more than one) Home Chord
    - Will create some harmonic expectations in the listener, based on how it develops. 
    - Two *strategies* (i.e. not a specfic tactic) for creating harmonic expection include: 
        1. Use of functional harmony
        2. Use of other harmonic patterns (e.g. parallelisms)
          
## Groupings of Chords:
- Phrases
- Hooks and Filler

## Phrases
- A chord progression can be partitioned into harmonic phrases
- A harmonic phrase usually tracks with (i.e. has the same length as) an accompanying melodic phrase (when it exists), but it doesn't need to be this way   
- A phrase is like a complete harmonic thought
- Can be any length, but typically an even number of measures (e.g. 4, 6, 8 are most common).              
- There can be one or many chords in a phrase, and some chords may be repeated.
- 3 types of chords in phrase:
    1. **Start Chord**
    2. **Interior Chord**
    3. **End Chord**
- Start Chord and End Chord can be the same or different        
- The Start Chord and End Chord can appear elsewhere in the phrase (i.e. not only at the start and end)  
- Starting and Ending Chord of phrases are major milestones in a chord progression
    - You generally want these sounds to be stable.
    - It's where a musical thought is completed.  
- Interior chords are any chords which occur within the phrase that are not the Start or End Chord

### Inner-Phrase Design
- Generally, the most important chords in the phrase are:
    - Start chord        
    - End Chord
    - Any Hooks (see below)
- The End Chord is the phrase's destination
    - The type of End Chord implies a musical intention for the whole phrase
    - It is, literally, the conclusion of the musical statement
- Typical End Chords are
    1. Start Chord of current or another phrase
    2. A Chord which resolves to the phrase's Start Chord
    3. A Chord which resolves to the next phrase's Start Chord
- Types of Resolving Chords:
    - **Dominant Chord**
        - I'm redefining this as something that provides the strongest possible resolution to the Home Chord.
        - This could be a V - I resolution or something else, depending on the Home Chord.   
    - **SubDominant Chord**
        - I'm redefining this to anything that resolves to the Home Chord but with less finality / boldness than a Dominant chord.
        - Often also has a predominant function                  
- Notation for phrase classification:
    - (*EndChordPrevPhrase* => **_StartChordNumeral_**) - `hook` - (**_EndChordNumeral_** => *StartChordNextPhrase*)
        - Symbols:
            - =>> : Strong / Dominant resolution
            - ->> : Weak / SubDominant resolution
            - => : Interesting change
            - - : Stuff happens
        - Only include the EndChordPrevPhrase or StartChordNextPhrase if there's a resolution to be noted
        - Stuff in the ( ) are start chords and end chords
        - Hooks are optional

### Composition of Phrases
- In forms which are > 1 phrase, you'll want to have some variation in the Start Chord and End Chord across phrases (See section below on Composition of Phrases)
- First Phrase Characteristics:
    - TODO
- Last Phrase Characteristics:
    - The last bar of your last phrase will typically be:
        - your Home Chord OR
        - a chord which will resolve to your Home Chord when you repeat (e.g. turnaround)
        - A "deceptive" cadence:
            - a quality variation of your Home Chord, such as a picardy third, which raises the expected minor chord to a major.
            - In jazz, there are a number of alterations to the last chord  
- Phrase Overlaps:
    - Phrases can elide/dovetail
        - typically by one bar when the End Chord of the previous phrase matches the Start Chord of the following phrase.
    - Phrases might have codas
        - The coda will be attached to the end of the phrase
        - It will be shorter than it's attached overall phrase
        - Primary function is to reiterate some harmonic, rhythmic, or melodic cadence

## Hooks and Fillers
- You can partition any chord progression into two types, **Hooks** and **Filler**
- Hooks have a sound which catches your attention
- Hooks can sound:
    - New, Fresh
    - Suprising, going against your expectations
    - Unsettling        
    - Introduces a new feeling
- Examples of hooks:
    - Modulation
    - I -> bIII
- Hooks can be individual chords (e.g. a particular chord sub), but generally, they're more than one chord.     
- In a modulation, the pivot chord which resolves to the new key would be part of the hook
    - You might introduce a chord which has some ambiguity (e.g. bVII chord) and makes it easy to introduce some new sound
- Filler segments blend in and reinforce an the dominant (not Dominant chord) or expected sound
- A chord progression should usually have more filler than hooks 
    - The filler creates an expectations in the user, which makes the hooks effective
    - Hooks and Fillers are easier to identify when there is more filler
- Hooks can occur anywhere in a phrase or across a phrase.
- Ways to *Unsettle*
    - Change the quality
    - Use a non-diatonic chord
    - Harmonic ambiguity

## Common Resolutions
- iv
    - bVII => iv  (plagal-ish)
- i
    - bVII => i
        - Kinda like a deceptive cadence because the bVII is the V of the relative I, 

## Options By Chords 
- **Options from a I**
    - Lengthening: Keeping in basic tonality 
        - Sus
        - Involving the lead-tone:
            - Imaj7
            - iii
                - sometimes sounds like a (diatonic) hook
                - pretty much the same as the first descending bass line variation
            - Keep I, descending bass line
    - New Sounds
        - i 
- **Options from a i**
    - Lengthening
        - III
        - Keep i, descending base line from root
        - Keep i, ascending from 5th scale degree (a la james bond)
- **Options from a ii**
    - If you're planning a ii-V, you can use secondary doms to make it ii-II-V
- **Options from a V**
    - Lengthinging:
        - V => V7
        
## Passing Chords
- Secondary V's or IV's are not passing chords
- Only function should be creating smoother voice leading to the next chord   
        
## Places to Use an Aug Chord
- V+ => i (the aug 5 becomes the b3)
- You get one when you do a descending base line from i

## Difference between Symmetry and Repetition
- Symmetry in a melody / harmony is more like a palindromic thing
- Repetition is ... repetition

## The bVII
- TODO

## IV => iv
- Once you've established a IV, you can always hit a iv
    - And then you can play around w both variations
- This doesn't seem to work when you start with iv.

### The iii/III chord and the vi/VI
- The iii/III can give you a new quality on the I/i, and it sets up motion
- The vi/VI is like the iii/III of the IV/iv, so it's more related to a subdom function
- The iii/III often takes you to a bVII when you're trying to land on the IV
    - Another likey destination is the vi/VI

## Techniques
- Frequency of chord types in a progression
    - Examples how repetition affect our expectations and impressions on the character of the sound.
    - Examples like 
        - Lengthening a V sound can help give a phrase a more Vish sound, which is useful in the phrase composition
        - You could create a new Home Chord by brute force repetition  

## TODOS
- The Argument as a Metaphor for chord progressions (ie having a thesis/conclusion like sound, and finding ways of reinforcing/supporting it based on logic or similar sounds)
    - You can do things that are logical but non-diatonic and they sound ok (e.g. sequences or playing a half-step up)
- The Joke as a Metaphor for chord progression (ie creating expectation and surprises)
- Elaborate on unsettling types
- quality: it's in the key sig/tonality but a different maj/min (like the use of the iii / III)
- Non-diatonic chord (NEED EXAMPLES)
- Good way of setting up a modulation: a phrase centered on the V (moving from V - subdom chords, without resolving - then going back to V), then on the next phrase instead of resolving, modulate!
- If you want to extend a ii-V, you can always use a ii-II-V because the II is really just a secondary dom of V
- if you have a phrase that you want to reiterate, but it sounds kinda stale repeating, just replace the first chord (assuming it's the i/I) with it's relative min/maj chord.  (Example- phrase 2, sally's song)
- bVII in a minor key is the V of the relative maj, so a decent place to end a phrase
